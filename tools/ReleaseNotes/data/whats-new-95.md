## Upgrade to Aspire 9.5

> [!NOTE] Try out the new update command!
> Aspire 9.5 brings a new preview CLI command - [aspire update](#new-aspire-update-command-preview) - that can update your AppHost and its packages for you. Get the latest CLI if you want to try and give us feedback about it on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues)!

Moving between minor releases of Aspire is simple:

1. Get the latest release of the Aspire CLI:
    
    ```bash
    # Bash
    curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash
    
    # PowerShell
    iex "& { $(irm https://aspire.dev/install.ps1) }"
    ```

1. In your AppHost project file (that is, _MyApp.AppHost.csproj_), update the [📦 Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) NuGet package to version `9.5.0`:

    ```xml
    <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.5.0" />
    ```

    For more information, see [Aspire SDK](xref:dotnet/aspire/sdk).

1. Check for any NuGet package updates, either using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the **Update NuGet Package** command from C# Dev Kit in VS Code.

1. Update to the latest [Aspire templates](../fundamentals/aspire-sdk-templates.md) by running the following .NET command line:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates
    ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `dotnet new install` command will update existing Aspire templates to the latest version if they are already installed.

If your AppHost project file doesn't have the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` reference, you might still be using Aspire 8. To upgrade to 9, follow [the upgrade guide](../get-started/upgrade-to-aspire-9.md).

## 🛠️ CLI and tooling

### Channel-aware `aspire add` & templating

You can now pick packages from different channels or versions during `aspire add` (#10801, #10899). Additionally, friendly name generation is now more flexible for searching packages.

### New `aspire update` command (preview)

The new `aspire update` command helps you keep your Aspire projects current by automatically detecting and updating outdated packages and templates.

```bash
# Analyze and update out-of-date Aspire packages & templates
aspire update
```

**Features:**
- **Automated package detection**: Finds outdated Aspire NuGet packages while respecting channel configurations
- **Diamond dependency resolution**: Intelligently handles complex dependency graphs without duplicate updates (#11145)
- **Enhanced reporting**: Colorized output with detailed summary of changes (#11148)
- **Channel awareness**: Respects your configured Aspire channel (preview, stable, etc.)
- **Safe updates**: Validates package compatibility before applying changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🧪 **Preview Feature**: The `aspire update` command is in preview and may change before general availability.

### Enhanced markdown and styling support

Extended markdown rendering support (#10815) with improved developer experience:

- **Code fences** with syntax highlighting for better readability
- **Rich text formatting** including emphasis, bold, and inline code
- **Structured lists** with bullet points and numbering
- **Safe markup escaping** to prevent XSS and rendering issues (#10462)
- Purple styling for default values in prompts (#10474)

### File-based AppHost support in preview

Aspire 9.5 introduces infrastructure for .NET 10's new file-based apps feature, meaning you only need 1 file - and no project file! - for your Aspire apphost. The new capabilities are currently behind a feature flag that elevates the minimum .NET SDK requirement to prepare for upcoming file-based app execution scenarios.

```bash
# Enable single-file AppHost support (requires .NET 10.0.100 RC1+)
aspire config set features.singlefileAppHostEnabled true
```

**SDK version requirements:**
- **Default (flag disabled)**: Requires .NET SDK 9.0.302 or later
- **Feature enabled**: Requires .NET SDK 10.0.100 RC1 or later
- **Override support**: Manual SDK version overrides continue to work with highest precedence

### SSH Remote support for port forwarding

Version 9.5 adds first-class support for SSH Remote development environments, extending automatic port forwarding configuration to VS Code SSH Remote scenarios alongside existing Devcontainer and Codespaces support.

**Features:**
- **Automatic environment detection**: Detects SSH Remote scenarios via `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK_CLI` and `SSH_CONNECTION` environment variables
- **Seamless port forwarding**: Automatically configures VS Code settings for Aspire application endpoints
- **Consistent developer experience**: Matches existing behavior for Devcontainers and Codespaces
- **No configuration required**: Works out-of-the-box when using VS Code SSH Remote extension

SSH Remote environments are automatically detected when both environment variables are present:

```bash
# SSH Remote environment variables (automatically set)
export SSH_CONNECTION="192.168.1.1 12345 192.168.1.2 22"
export VSCODE_IPC_HOOK_CLI="/path/to/vscode/hook"

# Aspire automatically detects and configures port forwarding
dotnet run --project MyApp.AppHost
```

Perfect for remote development scenarios:
- **Remote server development**: Working on a remote Linux server via SSH
- **Cloud development environments**: Using cloud-based development VMs
- **Team development servers**: Shared development environments accessed via SSH
- **Cross-platform development**: Developing on remote machines with different OS

The SSH Remote support follows the exact same patterns as existing Devcontainer and Codespaces integration, ensuring a consistent experience across all VS Code remote development scenarios. Port forwarding settings are automatically written to `.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json` when SSH Remote environments are detected.

### `aspire exec` command enhancements

The `aspire exec` command allows you to execute commands within the context of your Aspire application environment, inheriting environment variables and configuration from your app model resources.

Building on the 9.4 preview, version 9.5 adds several key improvements:

- `--workdir` (`-w`) flag to run commands inside a specific working directory (#10912)
- Fail-fast argument validation with clearer error messages (#10606)
- Improved help and usage text for better developer experience (#10598)

#### Basic usage examples

```bash
# Execute database migrations with environment variables from your app model
aspire exec --resource my-api -- dotnet ef database update

# Run commands in a specific working directory
aspire exec --resource worker --workdir /app/tools -- dotnet run

# Wait for resource to start before executing command
aspire exec --start-resource my-worker -- npm run build
```

#### Command syntax

- Use `--resource` to execute immediately when AppHost starts
- Use `--start-resource` to wait for the resource to be running first
- Use `--workdir` to specify the working directory for the command
- Use `--` to separate aspire options from the command to execute

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🧪 **Feature Flag**: The `aspire exec` command requires explicit enablement with:
>
> ```bash
> aspire config set features.execCommandEnabled true
> ```

### Other tweaks

- Relative path included in AppHost status messages + TUI dashboard (#11132)
- Clean Spectre Console debug logging with reduced noise (#11125)
- Directory safety check for `aspire new` (#10496) and consistent template inputs (#10444, #10508)
- Refactored NuGet prefetch architecture (#11120) reducing UI lag during `aspire new` on macOS (#11069) and enabling command-aware caching. Temporary NuGet config improvements ensure wildcard mappings (#10894).
- Context-sensitive completion messages for publish/deploy (#10501)
- Markdown-to-Spectre converter foundation reuse (#10815)
- Interaction answer typing change (`object`) for future extensibility (#10480)
- Improved CTRL+C message and experience

> The `aspire exec` and `aspire update` commands remain in preview behind feature flags; behavior may change in a subsequent release.

## Dashboard enhancements

### Deep-linked telemetry navigation

The dashboard now provides seamless navigation between different telemetry views with interactive elements in property grids. Trace IDs, span IDs, resource names, and log levels become clickable buttons for one-click navigation (#10648).

- **Trace IDs**: Click to view the complete distributed trace
- **Span IDs**: Navigate directly to specific trace spans
- **Resource names**: Jump to resource-specific telemetry views  
- **Log levels**: Filter logs by severity level instantly

This eliminates the need to manually copy/paste identifiers between different dashboard views, making debugging and monitoring much more efficient.

### Multi-resource console logs

A new "All" option in the console logs view streams logs from every running resource simultaneously (#10981).

**Features:**
- **Unified log stream**: See logs from all resources in chronological order
- **Color-coded prefixes**: Each resource gets a deterministic color for easy identification  
- **Configurable timestamps**: Separate timestamp preference to reduce noise
- **Real-time updates**: Live streaming of log events across your application

**Example log output:**

```text
[api      INF] Application starting up
[postgres INF] Database system is ready to accept connections  
[redis    INF] Server initialized, ready to accept connections
[api      INF] Connected to database successfully
```

### Custom resource icons

Resources can specify custom icons using `WithIconName()` for better visual identification in dashboard views (#10760).

```csharp
var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("database")
    .WithIconName("database");

var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache")
    .WithIconName("memory");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithIconName("web-app");
```

**Icon variant options:**

```csharp
// Available variants: Regular (outline) or Filled (solid, default)
var database = builder.AddPostgres("db")
    .WithIconName("database", ApplicationModel.IconVariant.Regular);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithIconName("web-app", ApplicationModel.IconVariant.Filled);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default icon variant is `Filled` if not specified.

This helps teams quickly identify different types of resources in complex applications with many services. Custom resource icons now also apply to project & container resources via unified annotation, providing consistent visual identification across all resource types.

### Reverse proxy support

The dashboard now properly handles reverse proxy scenarios with explicit forwarded header mapping when enabled. This fixes common issues with authentication redirects and URL generation behind proxies like YARP (#10388).

```bash
# Enable forwarded headers processing
export ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED=true
```

**Supported scenarios:**
- **OpenID Connect authentication** works correctly behind reverse proxies
- **URL generation** respects the original client request scheme and host
- **Limited header processing** for security - only Host and X-Forwarded-Proto are processed
- **YARP integration** and other reverse proxy solutions

This is particularly useful for deployment scenarios where the dashboard is accessed through a load balancer or reverse proxy.

### Improved mobile experience

The mobile and desktop experience has been redesigned with better responsive layouts and improved usability across all dashboard pages (#10407).

- **Responsive toolbars**: Automatically adapt to screen size
- **Touch-friendly controls**: Larger targets for mobile interaction  
- **Optimized layouts**: Better use of screen real estate on smaller devices
- **Consistent navigation**: Unified experience across desktop and mobile

### Enhanced resource management

Several improvements to resource management and debugging capabilities:

**Resource organization:**
- **Sub-menu organization**: Resource action menus now use sub-menus to prevent overflow on complex applications (#10869)
- **Launch profile details**: Project resources now show their associated launch profile for easier debugging (#10906)
- **Improved navigation**: Better resource selection and navigation handling (#10848)
- **Launch profile localization**: Launch profile localization and model surfaced in dashboard resource details ([#10906](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10906))

**Debugging enhancements:**
- **Direct launch profile access**: Quick access to the launch configuration used for each project
- **Resource state visibility**: Clearer indication of resource status and health
- **Action grouping**: Related resource actions are logically grouped for better discoverability

### Container runtime notifications

Smart notifications appear when Docker/Podman is installed but unhealthy, with automatic dismissal when runtime recovers (#11008). This provides immediate feedback when your container runtime needs attention, helping diagnose startup issues faster.

### UI improvements

- Error spans use consistent error styling (#10742)
- Better default icons for parameters and services (#10762)
- Improved navigation reliability (#10848)
- Enhanced port parsing (#10884)
- Message truncation for long log entries (#10882)
- Optional log line wrapping (#10271)
- Improved text visualizer dialog (#10964)

### Trace performance & integration

- Optimized trace detail page rendering (#10308)
- Embedded log entries within trace spans (#10281)
- Better span timing calculations (#10310)

### Localization & deployment

- Comprehensive dashboard localization with consolidated resource files
- Launch profile support with localized display names (#10906)
- Forwarded headers support for proxy/container scenarios (#10388)

### GenAI insights

New dialog and UI components make GenAI interactions easier to inspect and understand (#11227, #11286).

### Richer markdown rendering

Enhanced markdown rendering with syntax highlighting and better code block handling improves readability of generated or diagnostic content (#11286).

### Trace filtering

New span type filter lets you focus on specific kinds of spans for faster investigation (#11262).

### Trace detail improvements

Expand/collapse all, clearer exemplars, added resource column, preserved root span visibility, and more reliable span linking (#9474, #11089, #11085, #11078, #10747).

### Logging usability

Cleaner unified All view, removed redundant None option, clearer error log styling (#11087, #10725, #10481).

### Navigation & accessibility

Better toolbar/menu overflow handling, improved keyboard navigation, semantic headings, mobile navigation scroll fixes (#10740, #10708, #10729, #11317, #10893, #9827).

### Resource menus

Streamlined resource action menus and clearer command labeling (#10869, #11328).

### Runtime visibility

Always shows the .NET runtime version and improves framework detection (#11330, #11095).

## Integration changes and additions

### OpenAI hosting integration

The new `AddOpenAI` integration provides first-class support for modeling OpenAI endpoints and their associated models within your Aspire application graph.

**Features:**
- **Single OpenAI endpoint** resource with child model resources using `AddModel`
- **Parameter-based API key** provisioning with `ParameterResource` support
- **Endpoint override** for local gateways, proxies, or self-hosted solutions
- **Resource referencing** so other projects automatically receive connection information

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiKey = builder.AddParameter("openai-api-key", secret: true);

var openai = builder.AddOpenAI("openai")
    .WithApiKey(apiKey)
    .WithEndpoint("https://api.openai.com");

var chatModel = openai.AddModel("chat", "gpt-4o-mini");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(chatModel);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Local development scenario:**

```csharp
// Use with local OpenAI-compatible services
var localOpenAI = builder.AddOpenAI("local-openai")
    .WithApiKey(builder.AddParameter("local-api-key"))
    .WithEndpoint("http://localhost:11434"); // Ollama or similar

var localModel = localOpenAI.AddModel("local-chat", "llama3.2");
```

### GitHub Models typed catalog

Version 9.5 introduces a strongly-typed catalog for GitHub-hosted models, providing IntelliSense support and refactoring safety when working with AI models (#10986).

**Benefits over string-based approach:**
- **Type safety**: Compile-time validation of model names
- **IntelliSense support**: Discover available models and providers  
- **Refactoring safety**: Rename and find references work correctly
- **Up-to-date catalog**: Daily automation ensures new models are available (#11040)

```csharp
// Before: String-based approach (error-prone)
var model = github.AddModel("chat", "gpt-4o-mini"); // Typos not caught

// After: Typed catalog approach  
var chatModel = github.AddModel("chat", GitHubModel.OpenAI.Gpt4oMini);
var claudeModel = github.AddModel("claude", GitHubModel.Anthropic.Claude3_5Sonnet);
var llamaModel = github.AddModel("llama", GitHubModel.Meta.Llama3_1_405B_Instruct);

// IntelliSense shows all available models grouped by provider
var embeddingModel = github.AddModel("embeddings", GitHubModel.OpenAI.TextEmbedding3Large);
```

**Complete GitHub Models integration:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure GitHub Models with token
var githubToken = builder.AddParameter("github-token", secret: true);

var github = builder.AddGitHubModels("github-models")
    .WithToken(githubToken);

// Add multiple model types with strong typing
var chatModel = github.AddModel("gpt4o", GitHubModel.OpenAI.Gpt4o);
var fastModel = github.AddModel("gpt4o-mini", GitHubModel.OpenAI.Gpt4oMini);
var claudeModel = github.AddModel("claude", GitHubModel.Anthropic.Claude3_5Sonnet);

// Use in your applications
var aiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AIService>("ai-service")
    .WithReference(chatModel)
    .WithReference(fastModel)
    .WithReference(claudeModel);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The typed catalog automatically updates daily, so newly published models on GitHub become available without waiting for an Aspire release.

### Dev Tunnels hosting integration

Aspire 9.5 introduces first-class support for Azure Dev Tunnels, enabling seamless integration of secure public tunnels for your applications during development and testing scenarios.

**Features:**
- **Secure public tunnels**: Create public HTTPS endpoints for applications running locally
- **Automatic tunnel management**: Tunnels are created, configured, and cleaned up automatically
- **Private and anonymous tunnels**: Support for both authenticated private tunnels and public anonymous access
- **Development workflow integration**: Perfect for webhook testing, mobile app development, and external service integration

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add a basic Dev Tunnel resource (default: private access)
var tunnel = builder.AddDevTunnel("dev-tunnel");

// Add your web application
var webApp = builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApp>("webapp");

// Connect the tunnel to the web application endpoint
tunnel.WithReference(webApp.GetEndpoint("http"));

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Advanced tunnel configuration:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApi>("api");

// Create a tunnel with custom options; choose anonymous OR keep private
var tunnel = builder.AddDevTunnel("api-tunnel", options: new DevTunnelOptions
{
    Description = "API development tunnel",
    Labels = ["development", "api"]
});

// Uncomment to allow anonymous (public) access instead of private authenticated access
// tunnel.WithAnonymousAccess();

// Connect the tunnel to the API endpoint
tunnel.WithReference(api.GetEndpoint("https"));

// Reference the tunnel from other resources
var webhookProcessor = builder.AddProject<Projects.WebhookProcessor>("webhook-processor")
    .WithReference(api, tunnel); // Gets tunneled endpoint information

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Use cases:**

**Webhook Development**: Test webhooks from external services (GitHub, Stripe, etc.) against your locally running API:

```csharp
// Webhook API with public tunnel (anonymous access for external service callbacks)
var webhookApi = builder.AddProject<Projects.WebhookApi>("webhook-api");

var publicTunnel = builder.AddDevTunnel("webhook-tunnel")
    .WithAnonymousAccess()
    .WithReference(webhookApi.GetEndpoint("http"));
```

**Mobile App Testing**: Enable mobile devices to connect to your local development server:

```csharp
// Mobile backend with private tunnel (authenticated access only)
var mobileBackend = builder.AddProject<Projects.MobileBackend>("mobile-backend");

var mobileTunnel = builder.AddDevTunnel("mobile-tunnel")
    .WithReference(mobileBackend.GetEndpoint("http"));
```

The Dev Tunnels integration automatically handles Azure authentication, tunnel lifecycle management, and provides public or private URLs (depending on configuration) to connected resources, making it easy to expose local development services securely to external consumers.

### YARP static files support

Aspire 9.5 adds comprehensive static file serving capabilities to the YARP integration, enabling you to serve static assets directly from YARP alongside reverse proxy functionality. This is perfect for single-page applications, frontend assets, and hybrid scenarios where you need both static content and API proxying.

**Features:**
- **Direct static file serving**: Serve HTML, CSS, JS, and other static assets from YARP
- **Flexible source options**: Bind mount local directories or use Docker multi-stage builds
- **Automatic configuration**: Simple API enables static files with minimal setup
- **Production ready**: Works in both development and publish scenarios

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Enable static file serving (serves from wwwroot folder)
var yarp = builder.AddYarp("gateway")
    .WithStaticFiles();

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Bind mount local directory:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Serve static files from local directory
var yarp = builder.AddYarp("static-gateway")
    .WithStaticFiles("./static-content")
    .WithConfiguration(gateway =>
    {
        // Add API routes alongside static files
        gateway.AddRoute("/api/{**catch-all}", backendService)
               .WithTransformPathRemovePrefix("/api");
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Docker multi-stage build scenario:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Use Dockerfile to build and copy static assets
var frontend = builder.AddYarp("frontend")
    .WithStaticFiles()
    .WithDockerFile("../react-app");

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Example Dockerfile for React app:**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build React app
FROM node:20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Copy static files to YARP container
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly/yarp:2.3.0-preview.4 AS yarp
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./wwwroot
```

**Hybrid static + API gateway:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var backendApi = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api");
var authService = builder.AddProject<Projects.Auth>("auth");

// YARP serves static files AND proxies API requests
var gateway = builder.AddYarp("app-gateway")
    .WithStaticFiles("./frontend/dist")
    .WithConfiguration(yarp =>
    {
        // API routes
        yarp.AddRoute("/api/{**catch-all}", backendApi)
            .WithTransformPathRemovePrefix("/api");
            
        // Auth routes
        yarp.AddRoute("/auth/{**catch-all}", authService)
            .WithTransformPathRemovePrefix("/auth");
            
        // Static files are served for all other routes
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

This feature enables modern web application architectures where YARP acts as both a reverse proxy for backend services and a static file server for frontend assets, providing a unified entry point for your distributed application.

### Redis and RabbitMQ auto activation

Redis and RabbitMQ connections now support auto activation to prevent startup deadlocks and improve application reliability.

**Features:**
- **Eliminates blocking threads**: Connections are established proactively at startup rather than on first use
- **Prevents startup deadlocks**: Avoids synchronous connection establishment in dependency injection scenarios
- **Improves reliability**: Reduces first-request latency by pre-establishing connections
- **Configurable behavior**: Can be enabled or disabled per connection as needed

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Auto activation enabled by default for Redis
var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");

// Use in applications - connection is already established
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(redis);

builder.Build().Run();
```

#### RabbitMQ auto activation configuration

```csharp
// Application (not AppHost) code
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

// Default: auto activation ENABLED (no extra configuration required)
builder.AddRabbitMQClient("messaging");

// --- OR --- Opt out of auto activation (connection will be created lazily)
// builder.AddRabbitMQClient("messaging", settings =>
// {
//     settings.DisableAutoActivation = true; // disable auto activation
// });

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

### Redis client builder pattern

Aspire 9.5 introduces a new Redis client builder pattern that provides a fluent, type-safe approach to configuring Redis clients with integrated support for distributed caching, output caching, and Azure authentication.

**Features:**

- **Fluent configuration**: Chain multiple Redis features like distributed caching, output caching, and Azure authentication
- **Type-safe builders**: `AspireRedisClientBuilder` provides compile-time safety and IntelliSense
- **Integrated Azure authentication**: Seamless Azure AD/Entra ID authentication with `WithAzureAuthentication`
- **Service composition**: Build complex Redis configurations with multiple features in a single call chain

#### Basic Redis client builder usage

```csharp
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.AddRedisClientBuilder("cache")
    .WithDistributedCache()
    .WithOutputCache();

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

**Azure authentication integration:**

#### Azure authentication integration

```csharp
// Azure authentication integration (application code)
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.AddRedisClientBuilder("azure-redis")
    .WithAzureAuthentication()  // Uses default Azure credentials
    .WithDistributedCache(options => 
    {
        options.InstanceName = "MyApp";
    });

// Or with custom credentials
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
builder.AddRedisClientBuilder("azure-redis")
    .WithAzureAuthentication(credential)
    .WithOutputCache();

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

**Advanced Redis builder patterns:**

#### Advanced Redis builder patterns

```csharp
// Multiple Redis instances with different configurations (application code)
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

// Cache-focused Redis instance
builder.AddRedisClientBuilder("cache")
    .WithDistributedCache(options => 
    {
        options.InstanceName = "MainCache";
        options.DefaultSlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    });

// Output cache Redis instance with Azure authentication
builder.AddKeyedRedisClientBuilder("output-cache")
    .WithAzureAuthentication()
    .WithOutputCache();

// Session Redis instance
builder.AddKeyedRedisClientBuilder("sessions") 
    .WithDistributedCache(options =>
    {
        options.InstanceName = "Sessions";
    });

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

### Azure AI Foundry enhancements

9.5 adds a generated, strongly-typed model catalog (`AIFoundryModel`) for IntelliSense + ref safety when creating deployments (PR #10986) and a daily automation that refreshes the catalog as new models appear in Azure AI Foundry (PR #11040). Sample apps and end-to-end tests now use these constants (PR #11039) instead of raw strings. The original Foundry hosting integration and local runtime support were introduced earlier (issue #9568); this release focuses on developer ergonomics and keeping model metadata current.

Strongly-typed model catalog with IntelliSense support:

```csharp
var aiFoundry = builder.AddAzureAIFoundry("ai-foundry");

// Strongly-typed model references
var gpt4 = aiFoundry.AddDeployment("gpt-4", AIFoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt4);
var mistral = aiFoundry.AddDeployment("mistral", AIFoundryModel.MistralAi.MistralLarge2411);

// Local on-device mode
var localFoundry = builder.AddAzureAIFoundry("local-ai")
  .RunAsFoundryLocal();
```

### Azure App Configuration emulator APIs

Run emulators locally with full configuration support:

```csharp
var appConfig = builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration("config")
  .RunAsEmulator(emulator => emulator
    .WithDataVolume("config-data")
    .WithHostPort(8080));
```

### Azure Storage emulator improvements

Updated Azurite to version 3.35.0, resolving health check issues that previously returned HTTP 400 responses (#10972). This improves the reliability of Azure Storage emulator health checks during development.

### Broader Azure resource capability surfacing

Several Azure hosting resource types now implement `IResourceWithEndpoints` enabling uniform endpoint discovery and waiting semantics:

- `AzureAIFoundryResource`
- `AzureAppConfigurationResource`
- `AzureKeyVaultResource`
- `AzurePostgresFlexibleServerResource`
- `AzureRedisCacheResource`

### Azure Redis Enterprise support

Aspire 9.5 introduces first-class support for Azure Redis Enterprise, providing a high-performance, fully managed Redis service with enterprise-grade features.

The new `AddAzureManagedRedis` extension method enables Redis Enterprise resource modeling:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add Azure Redis Enterprise resource
var redisEnterprise = builder.AddAzureManagedRedis("redis-enterprise");

// Use in your applications
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(redisEnterprise);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Local development with container emulation:**

```csharp
var redisEnterprise = builder.AddAzureManagedRedis("redis-enterprise")
    .RunAsContainer(container => container
        .WithHostPort(6379));
```

**Authentication options:**

```csharp
// With access key authentication (default)
var redisEnterprise = builder.AddAzureManagedRedis("redis-enterprise")
    .WithAccessKeyAuthentication();

// With Key Vault integration for access keys
var keyVault = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("keyvault");
var redisEnterprise = builder.AddAzureManagedRedis("redis-enterprise")
    .WithAccessKeyAuthentication(keyVault);
```

Azure Redis Enterprise provides advanced caching capabilities with clustering, high availability, and enterprise security features while maintaining compatibility with the standard Redis APIs.

### Azure resource reference properties

New reference properties have been added to Azure PostgreSQL and Redis resources for custom connection string composition and individual component access (#11051, #11070).

**AzurePostgresFlexibleServerResource enhancements:**

Three new reference properties enable custom connection string composition:

- **`HostName`** (`ReferenceExpression`): Returns PostgreSQL server hostname with port
- **`UserName`** (`ReferenceExpression?`): Returns username for password authentication (null for Entra ID)  
- **`Password`** (`ReferenceExpression?`): Returns password for password authentication (null for Entra ID)

```csharp
var postgres = builder.AddAzurePostgresFlexibleServer("database")
    .WithPasswordAuthentication()
    .RunAsContainer();

var db = postgres.AddDatabase("appdb");

// Custom JDBC connection string
var jdbc = ReferenceExpression.Create($"jdbc:postgresql://{postgres.Resource.HostName}/{db.Resource.DatabaseName}");

// Custom PostgreSQL connection string  
var connectionString = ReferenceExpression.Create(
    $"Host={postgres.Resource.HostName};Username={postgres.Resource.UserName};Password={postgres.Resource.Password};Database={db.Resource.DatabaseName}");
```

**AzureRedisCacheResource enhancements:**

Two new reference properties enable custom Redis connection scenarios:

- **`HostName`** (`ReferenceExpression`): Returns Redis server hostname with port
- **`Password`** (`ReferenceExpression?`): Returns password when running as container (null in Azure mode)

```csharp
var redis = builder.AddAzureRedis("cache")
    .RunAsContainer();

// Custom Redis connection string
var customConnectionString = ReferenceExpression.Create($"{redis.Resource.HostName},password={redis.Resource.Password}");

// Access individual components
var hostName = redis.Resource.HostName; // e.g., "localhost:6379"
var password = redis.Resource.Password; // Available in container mode
```

### OTLP telemetry protocol selection

Enhanced OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) support with protocol selection capabilities, allowing you to choose between gRPC and HTTP protobuf transports for telemetry data.

```csharp
// Available protocol types
public enum OtlpProtocol
{
    Grpc = 0,           // Default: High performance, binary protocol
    HttpProtobuf = 1    // Alternative: HTTP-based transport
}
```

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OTLP telemetry with specific protocol
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithOtlpExporter(OtlpProtocol.HttpProtobuf);

// Use default gRPC protocol (recommended for performance)
var worker = builder.AddProject<Projects.Worker>("worker")
    .WithOtlpExporter();

// Configure multiple services with different protocols
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithOtlpExporter(OtlpProtocol.Grpc);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**When to use each protocol:**

- **gRPC (default)**: Best performance, smaller payload size, ideal for production
- **HTTP Protobuf**: Better firewall compatibility, easier debugging, good for development

### MySQL password improvements

Enhanced and standardized password handling for MySQL resources:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Secure password parameter
var password = builder.AddParameter("mysql-password", secret: true);

var mysql = builder.AddMySql("mysql")
    .WithPassword(password);

// Password can be updated during configuration
mysql.Resource.PasswordParameter = builder.AddParameter("new-mysql-password", secret: true);

// Environment-specific passwords
var devPassword = builder.Configuration["ConnectionStrings:MySQL:Password"];
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(devPassword))
{
    mysql.WithPassword(devPassword);
}

builder.Build().Run();
```

## App model enhancements

### Resource lifecycle events

Aspire 9.5 introduces new resource lifecycle event APIs that allow you to register callbacks for when resources stop, providing better control over cleanup and coordination during application shutdown.

The new `OnResourceStopped` extension method allows you to register callbacks that execute when a resource enters the stopped state:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres", "mypostgres")
    .OnResourceStopped(async (resource, stoppedEvent, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        // Perform cleanup when the database stops
        Console.WriteLine($"Database {resource.Name} has stopped");
        
        // Log final metrics, backup data, etc.
        await LogFinalMetrics(resource.Name);
    });

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .OnResourceStopped(async (resource, stoppedEvent, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        // Graceful API shutdown handling
        Console.WriteLine($"API service {resource.Name} is shutting down");
        await FlushPendingRequests();
    })
    .WithReference(database);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Resource stopped event details:**

The `ResourceStoppedEvent` provides information about the stopping event:

```csharp
// Register detailed stopped event handler
var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache")
    .OnResourceStopped(async (resource, stoppedEvent, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        // Access event details
        Console.WriteLine($"Resource: {resource.Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Event timestamp: {stoppedEvent.Timestamp}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Stopping reason: {stoppedEvent.Reason}");
        
        // Perform async cleanup with cancellation support
        await CleanupCacheConnections(cancellationToken);
    });
```

**Coordination with lifecycle management:**

Resource stopped events work seamlessly with existing lifecycle features:

```csharp
var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres")
    .OnResourceStopped(async (db, evt, ct) => 
    {
        await BackupDatabase(db.Name, ct);
    });

var worker = builder.AddProject<Projects.Worker>("worker")
    .WaitFor(database)  // Wait for startup
    .OnResourceStopped(async (svc, evt, ct) => 
    {
        await CompleteInFlightJobs(ct);
    })
    .WithReference(database);
```

New `ResourceStoppedEvent` provides lifecycle insight when resources shut down or fail ([#11103](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11103)):

```csharp
builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
  .OnResourceStopped(async (resource, evt, ct) =>
  {
      // Handle resource stopped event - log cleanup, notify other services, etc.
      Console.WriteLine($"Resource {resource.Name} stopped with event: {evt.ResourceEvent}");
      await NotifyDependentServices(resource.Name, ct);
  });
```

### Context-based endpoint resolution

**Breaking change**: Endpoint resolution in `WithEnvironment` callbacks now correctly resolves container hostnames instead of always using "localhost" (#8574).

```csharp
var redis = builder.AddRedis("redis");

// Another container getting endpoint info from Redis container
var rabbitmq = builder.AddContainer("myapp", "mycontainerapp")
    .WithEnvironment(context =>
    {
        var endpoint = redis.GetEndpoint("tcp");
        var redisHost = endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Host);
        var redisPort = endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port);

        // Previously: redisHost would always resolve to "localhost" 
        // Now: redisHost correctly resolves to "redis" (container name)
        context.EnvironmentVariables["REDIS_HOST"] = redisHost;
        context.EnvironmentVariables["REDIS_PORT"] = redisPort;
    })
    .WithReference(redis);
```

**What you need to review:**

- **Container deployments**: Your apps will now receive correct container hostnames
- **Local development**: Localhost behavior preserved for non-containerized scenarios  
- **Connection strings**: Automatic connection strings continue to work as expected
- **Manual environment**: Review custom `WithEnvironment` calls that assume localhost

### HTTP health probes for resources

Aspire 9.5 introduces comprehensive HTTP health probe support that allows you to configure startup, readiness, and liveness probes for your resources, providing better health monitoring and deployment coordination.

**Features:**

- **Multiple probe types**: Configure startup, readiness, and liveness probes independently
- **Flexible endpoint targeting**: Probe any HTTP endpoint with custom paths and configurations
- **Configurable timing**: Control probe intervals, timeouts, and failure thresholds
- **Kubernetes alignment**: Probe semantics align with Kubernetes health check concepts

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add readiness probe to ensure service is ready before routing traffic
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready");

// Add liveness probe to detect if service needs restart
var worker = builder.AddProject<Projects.Worker>("worker")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/health/live");

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Advanced probe configuration:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Comprehensive probe setup with custom timing
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpProbe(
        type: ProbeType.Startup,
        path: "/health/startup",
        initialDelaySeconds: 30,    // Wait 30s before first probe
        periodSeconds: 10,          // Probe every 10 seconds
        timeoutSeconds: 5,          // 5 second timeout per probe
        failureThreshold: 5,        // Consider failed after 5 failures
        successThreshold: 1         // Consider healthy after 1 success
    );

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Multiple probe types for comprehensive monitoring:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");

// Service with complete probe coverage
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    // Startup probe: Ensures service starts successfully
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Startup, "/health/startup", 
        initialDelaySeconds: 15, failureThreshold: 10)
    
    // Readiness probe: Determines when ready to receive traffic
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready",
        periodSeconds: 5, timeoutSeconds: 3)
    
    // Liveness probe: Detects if service is still functioning
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/health/live",
        periodSeconds: 30, failureThreshold: 3)
    
    .WithReference(database);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Custom endpoint targeting:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Probe specific endpoint by name
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(8080, name: "management")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/actuator/health", 
        endpointName: "management");

// Probe with endpoint selector function
var service = builder.AddProject<Projects.Service>("service")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/status",
        endpointSelector: () => service.GetEndpoint("https"));

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Integration with resource dependencies:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var cache = builder.AddRedis("redis");

// API with probes that check dependencies
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready") // Checks DB & Redis connectivity
    .WaitFor(database)  // Wait for database startup
    .WaitFor(cache)     // Wait for cache startup
    .WithReference(database)
    .WithReference(cache);

// Frontend waits for API to be ready (not just started)
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WaitFor(api)  // Waits for API readiness probe to pass
    .WithReference(api);

builder.Build().Run();
```

This feature enhances deployment reliability by providing fine-grained health monitoring that integrates seamlessly with Aspire's resource orchestration and dependency management.

### Enhanced resource waiting patterns

New `WaitForStart` method provides granular control over startup ordering, complementing existing `WaitFor` semantics (#10948). It also pairs with improved `ExternalService` health honoring (#10827) which ensures dependents truly wait for external resources to be healthy.

**Understanding wait behaviors:**

- **`WaitFor`**: Waits for dependency to be Running AND pass all health checks.
- **`WaitForStart`**: Waits only for dependency to reach Running (ignores health checks).

```csharp
var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var redis = builder.AddRedis("redis");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WaitForStart(postgres)  // New: startup only
    .WaitFor(redis)          // Healthy state
    .WithReference(postgres)
    .WithReference(redis);
```

**Migration scenario (database initialization):**

```csharp
var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");

var migrator = builder.AddProject<Projects.Migrator>("migrator")
    .WaitForStart(database)  // Start as soon as container is running
    .WithReference(database);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WaitFor(database)       // Healthy database
    .WaitFor(migrator)       // Migration completed
    .WithReference(database);
```

**ExternalService health integration:**

`WaitFor` now honors `ExternalService` health checks (#10827). Previously a dependent could start even if the external target failed its readiness probe.

```csharp
var externalApi = builder.AddExternalService("backend-api", "http://api.company.com")
    .WithHttpHealthCheck("/health/ready");

var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WaitFor(externalApi)    // Now waits for healthy external API
    .WithReference(externalApi);
```

If you need the old (lenient) behavior:

```csharp
// Do not wait for health
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithReference(externalApi);

// Or only wait for startup
var frontend2 = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend2")
    .WaitForStart(externalApi)
    .WithReference(externalApi);
```

### Enhanced resource lifetime support

**Breaking change**: Resources like `ParameterResource`, `ConnectionStringResource`, and GitHub Model resources now participate in lifecycle operations and support `WaitFor` (#10851, #10842). This section merges prior duplicate "Resource lifetime behavior" content.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var connectionString = builder.AddConnectionString("database");
var apiKey = builder.AddParameter("api-key", secret: true);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WaitFor(connectionString)
    .WaitFor(apiKey)
    .WithEnvironment("DB_CONNECTION", connectionString)
    .WithEnvironment("API_KEY", apiKey);

var github = builder.AddGitHubModels("github");
var model = github.AddModel("gpt4", GitHubModel.OpenAI.Gpt4o);

var aiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AIService>("ai-service")
    .WaitFor(model)
    .WithReference(model);

builder.Build().Run();
```

These resources no longer implement `IResourceWithoutLifetime`; they surface as Running and can be waited on just like services.

### Resource lifecycle event APIs

Aspire 9.5 introduces new resource lifecycle event APIs that allow you to hook into resource state transitions for custom logic execution.

The new `OnResourceStopped` extension method enables you to register callbacks that execute when a resource transitions to the stopped state:

```csharp
var database = builder.AddSqlServer("sqlserver")
    .OnResourceStopped(async (resource, stoppedEvent, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        // Cleanup logic when database stops
        logger.LogInformation("Database {ResourceName} stopped", resource.Name);
        await PerformCleanupAsync(cancellationToken);
    });
```

**Complete lifecycle event coverage:**

Combined with existing lifecycle events, you now have full coverage of resource state transitions:

```csharp
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .OnResourceReady(async (resource, readyEvent, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        // Resource is running and healthy
        await RegisterWithServiceDiscoveryAsync(resource, cancellationToken);
    })
    .OnResourceStopped(async (resource, stoppedEvent, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        // Resource has stopped
        await UnregisterFromServiceDiscoveryAsync(resource, cancellationToken);
    });
```

This provides symmetrical lifecycle management for scenarios like service registration/deregistration, resource cleanup, logging, and custom monitoring integration.

## Publishing and Deployment

### Parameter prompting during deploy

Aspire 9.5 enhances the deployment experience by automatically prompting for unresolved parameters during `aspire deploy` operations, eliminating the need to manually specify all parameter values upfront.

#### Interactive parameter resolution

When deploying your Aspire application, any parameters without values are now automatically detected and prompted for interactively:

```bash
# Deploy command detects missing parameters and prompts automatically
aspire deploy

🔧 Resolving deployment parameters...

Enter value for 'database-password' (secret): ********
Enter value for 'api-key' (secret): **********************
Enter value for 'environment-name': production

✅ All parameters resolved, proceeding with deployment...
```

#### Benefits of interactive parameter prompting

- **Secure credential entry**: Sensitive parameters are masked during input
- **Deployment-time flexibility**: No need to pre-configure all parameter values
- **Error prevention**: Missing parameters are caught before deployment begins
- **Better developer experience**: Clear prompts with parameter descriptions

#### Parameter types supported

- **Secret parameters**: Automatically masked input for sensitive values
- **Standard parameters**: Regular text input with validation
- **Optional parameters**: Skipped if no value is provided

This feature builds on the existing parameter infrastructure and makes deployment workflows more intuitive, especially when working with multiple environments or sharing deployment scripts across team members.

### Azure Container App Jobs support

Aspire 9.5 introduces comprehensive support for Azure Container App Jobs, allowing you to deploy both project and container resources as background job workloads that can run on schedules, in response to events, or be triggered manually.

Container App Jobs complement the existing Container Apps functionality by providing a dedicated way to run finite workloads like data processing, ETL operations, batch jobs, and scheduled maintenance tasks.

#### Publishing resources as Container App Jobs

Use the new `PublishAsAzureContainerAppJob` extension method to publish resources as jobs:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Publish a project as a Container App Job
var dataProcessor = builder.AddProject<Projects.DataProcessor>("data-processor")
    .PublishAsAzureContainerAppJob((infrastructure, job) => {
        // Configure job-specific settings using Azure Provisioning APIs
        job.Configuration.TriggerType = TriggerType.Schedule;
        // Run daily at 2 AM
        job.Configuration.ScheduleTriggerConfig.CronExpression = "0 0 2 * * *";
    });

// Publish a container as a Container App Job  
var batchJob = builder.AddContainer("batch-job", "my-batch-image")
    .PublishAsAzureContainerAppJob((infrastructure, job) => {
        // Configure manual trigger job
        job.Configuration.TriggerType = TriggerType.Manual;
        job.Configuration.ReplicaRetryLimit = 3;
        job.Configuration.ReplicaTimeout = 1800; // 30 minutes
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

#### Job customization and configuration

The new `AzureContainerAppJobCustomizationAnnotation` enables fine-grained control over job behavior:

```csharp
var scheduledJob = builder.AddProject<Projects.ScheduledWorker>("scheduled-worker")
    .PublishAsAzureContainerAppJob((infrastructure, job) => {
        // Event-driven job configuration
        job.Configuration.TriggerType = TriggerType.Event;
        job.Configuration.EventTriggerConfig = new EventTriggerConfiguration
        {
            Scale = new JobScale
            {
                MinExecutions = 0,
                MaxExecutions = 10,
                PollingInterval = 30 // seconds
            }
        };
        job.Configuration.ReplicaRetryLimit = 3;
        job.Configuration.ReplicaTimeout = 1800; // 30 minutes
    });
```

This feature addresses issue #4366 and provides a unified development and deployment experience for both long-running services (Container Apps) and finite workloads (Container App Jobs) within your Aspire applications.

#### Simplified job configuration overloads

For common scenarios, Aspire 9.5 provides simplified overloads that reduce boilerplate code:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Scheduled job with cron expression
var scheduledJob = builder.AddProject<Projects.DailyProcessor>("daily-processor")
    .PublishAsAzureContainerAppJob("0 0 2 * * *"); // Run daily at 2 AM

// Manual job (default trigger type)
var manualJob = builder.AddContainer("batch-processor", "my-batch-image")
    .PublishAsAzureContainerAppJob(); // Manual trigger, ready for on-demand execution

builder.Build().Run();
```

These overloads provide convenient APIs for the most common job types while maintaining access to the full configuration API when advanced customization is needed.

### Azure provisioning & deployer

9.5 delivers the first iteration of the Azure provisioning & deployment pipeline that unifies interactive prompting, Bicep compilation, and mode-specific behavior (run vs publish) across Azure resources:

- New provisioning contexts separate run-mode and publish-mode flows ([#11094](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11094)).
- Graph-based dependency planning (`ResourceDeploymentGraph`) ensures correct ordering of resource provisioning.
- Improved error handling and idempotency for `AddAsExistingResource` across all Azure resources ([#10562](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/10562)).
- Support for deploying compute images and resources (custom images referenced in your environment) ([#11030](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11030)).
- Deploy individual Bicep modules instead of a monolithic `main.bicep` for clearer failure isolation and faster iteration ([#11098](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11098)).
- Localized interaction + notification strings across all provisioning prompts (multiple OneLocBuild PRs).

Provisioning automatically prompts for required values only once per run, caches results, and reuses them in publish-mode without re-prompting. This reduces friction when iterating locally while maintaining reproducibility for production publish.

### Azure deployer interactive command handling

The AppHost now wires Azure provisioning prompts into the standard interaction system (initial work in [#10038](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10038), extended in [#10792](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10792) and [#10845](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10845)). This enables:

- Consistent UX for parameter entry (names, descriptions, validation)
- Localized prompt text
- Support for non-interactive scenarios via pre-supplied parameters

### Azure resource idempotency & existing resources

Calling `AddAsExistingResource` is now idempotent across Azure hosting resource builders; repeated calls no longer cause duplicate annotations or inconsistent behavior ([#10562](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/10562)). This improves reliability when composing reusable extension methods.

### Compute image deployment

You can now reference and deploy custom compute images as part of Azure environment provisioning ([#11030](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11030)). This lays groundwork for richer VM/container hybrid topologies.

### Module-scoped Bicep deployment

Instead of generating a single aggregated template, 9.5 deploys individual Bicep modules ([#11098](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11098)). Failures surface with more precise context and partial successes require less rework.

### Publishing progress & activity reporting

`IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` was renamed to `IPublishingActivityReporter` and output formatting was reworked to provide clearer, structured progress (multiple commits culminating in improved messages). Expect more concise status lines and actionable error sections when using `aspire publish`.

### Parameter & interaction API updates

- `ParameterResource.Value` is now obsolete: switch to `await parameter.GetValueAsync()` or inject parameter resources directly ([#10363](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10363)). This change improves async value acquisition and avoids accidental blocking.
- Interaction inputs enforce server-side validation and required `Name` property (breaking, [#10835](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10835)).
- New notification terminology (renamed from MessageBar, [#10449](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10449)).
- `ExecuteCommandResult` now includes a `Canceled` property to track whether command execution was canceled by the user or system.
- Server-side validation of interaction inputs ([#10527](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10527)).

Migration example:

```csharp
// Before (deprecated)
var value = myParam.Value;

// After
var value = await myParam.GetValueAsync();
```

### InteractionInput API improvements

**Breaking change**: `InteractionInput` now requires `Name`; `Label` is optional (#10835).

#### Migration example

```csharp
// Before (9.4 and earlier)
var input = new InteractionInput
{
    Label = "Database Password",
    InputType = InputType.SecretText,
    Required = true
};

// After (9.5+)
var input = new InteractionInput
{
    Name = "database_password", // Required field identifier
    Label = "Database Password", // Optional (defaults to Name)
    InputType = InputType.SecretText,
    Required = true
};
```

This enables better form serialization and integration with interactive parameter processing.

### Executable resource configuration APIs

Enhanced APIs for configuring executable resources with command and working directory specifications.

#### WithCommand and WithWorkingDirectory APIs

New extension methods allow precise control over executable resource execution:

```csharp
// Configure executable with custom command and working directory
var processor = builder.AddExecutable("data-processor", "python")
    .WithCommand("main.py --batch-size 100")
    .WithWorkingDirectory("/app/data-processing")
    .WithArgs("--config", "production.json");

// Executable with specific working directory for relative paths
var buildTool = builder.AddExecutable("build-tool", "npm")
    .WithCommand("run build:production")
    .WithWorkingDirectory("./frontend");
```

#### Enhanced CommandLineArgsCallbackContext

The `CommandLineArgsCallbackContext` now includes resource information for context-aware argument building:

```csharp
var worker = builder.AddExecutable("worker", "dotnet")
    .WithArgs(context =>
    {
        // Access to the resource instance for dynamic configuration
        var resourceName = context.Resource.Name;
        var environment = context.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode ? "Development" : "Production";
        
        context.Args.Add("--resource-name");
        context.Args.Add(resourceName);
        context.Args.Add("--environment");
        context.Args.Add(environment);
    });
```

These APIs provide fine-grained control over executable resource configuration, enabling complex deployment scenarios and dynamic argument construction based on execution context.

### Interactive parameter processing APIs

Aspire 9.5 introduces the `ParameterProcessor` API for programmatic parameter resolution with interactive prompting capabilities.

#### ParameterProcessor API

The new experimental `ParameterProcessor` class enables applications to handle parameter resolution during runtime:

```csharp
// In your application startup or configuration
services.AddSingleton<ParameterProcessor>();

// Use parameter processor to initialize parameters
public async Task ConfigureAsync(ParameterProcessor processor)
{
    var parameters = new[]
    {
        builder.AddParameter("database-password", secret: true),
        builder.AddParameter("api-key", secret: true),
        builder.AddParameter("environment-name")
    };

    // Initialize parameters with interactive prompting
    await processor.InitializeParametersAsync(parameters, waitForResolution: true);
}
```

#### InteractionInputCollection enhancements

Enhanced parameter input handling with the new `InteractionInputCollection` type:

```csharp
// Enhanced interaction service with typed input collection
public async Task<InteractionResult<InteractionInputCollection>> ProcessParametersAsync()
{
    var inputs = new List<InteractionInput>
    {
        new() { Name = "username", Label = "Username", InputType = InputType.Text },
        new() { Name = "password", Label = "Password", InputType = InputType.Password },
        new() { Name = "environment", Label = "Environment", InputType = InputType.Select,
                Options = new[] { ("dev", "Development"), ("prod", "Production") } }
    };

    var result = await interactionService.PromptInputsAsync(
        "Configure Parameters", 
        "Enter application configuration:", 
        inputs);

    if (result.Success)
    {
        // Access inputs by name with type safety
        var username = result.Value["username"].Value;
        var password = result.Value["password"].Value;
        var environment = result.Value["environment"].Value;
    }

    return result;
}
```

The `InteractionInputCollection` provides indexed access by name and improved type safety for parameter processing workflows.

### Docker Compose Aspire Dashboard forwarding headers

`AddDockerComposeEnvironment(...).WithDashboard()` gained `WithForwardedHeaders()` to enable forwarded `Host` and `Proto` handling for dashboard scenarios behind reverse proxies or compose networks ([#11080](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/11080)). This mirrors the standalone dashboard forwarded header support and fixes auth redirect edge cases.

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("env")
  .WithComposeFile("docker-compose.yml")
  .WithDashboard(d => d.WithForwardedHeaders());
```

### Container build customization

`ContainerBuildOptions` support (commit [#10074](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/10074)) enables customizing the underlying `dotnet publish` invocation when Aspire builds project-sourced container images (for example to change configuration, trimming, or pass additional MSBuild properties). Use the new options hook on the project container image configuration to set MSBuild properties instead of maintaining a custom Dockerfile. (Exact API surface is intentionally summarized here to avoid drift; see API docs for `ContainerBuildOptions` in the hosting namespace for usage.)

### Deployment image tag callbacks

Aspire 9.5 introduces powerful deployment image tag callback APIs that allow dynamic generation of container image tags at deployment time, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.

#### Deployment tag callback features

- **Dynamic tag generation**: Calculate image tags based on deployment context, git commits, build numbers, or timestamps
- **Async callback support**: Perform asynchronous operations like API calls or file system access during tag generation
- **Deployment context access**: Access to deployment environment, resource information, and configuration
- **Flexible callback types**: Support for simple lambdas, context-aware callbacks, and async operations

#### Basic deployment tag examples

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Simple static tag callback
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(() => "v1.2.3-stable");

// Dynamic tag with timestamp
var worker = builder.AddProject<Projects.Worker>("worker")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(() => $"build-{DateTime.UtcNow:yyyyMMdd-HHmm}");

builder.Build().Run();
```

#### Context-aware deployment tags

```csharp
// Access deployment context for dynamic tag generation
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(context =>
    {
        // Access resource information
        var resourceName = context.Resource.Name;
        var environment = context.Environment;
        
        return $"{resourceName}-{environment}-{GetBuildNumber()}";
    });

// Git-based tagging
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(context =>
    {
        var gitCommit = GetGitCommitHash();
        var branch = GetCurrentBranch();
        return $"{branch}-{gitCommit[..8]}";
    });
```

#### Async deployment tag callbacks

```csharp
// Async callback for complex tag generation
var database = builder.AddProject<Projects.Database>("database")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(async context =>
    {
        // Perform async operations during deployment
        var buildInfo = await GetBuildInfoFromApi();
        var version = await ReadVersionFromFile();
        
        return $"db-{version}-build{buildInfo.Number}";
    });

// API-based version lookup
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(async context =>
    {
        using var client = new HttpClient();
        var latestTag = await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.company.com/latest-tag");
        return $"api-{latestTag.Trim()}";
    });
```

#### Advanced deployment scenarios

```csharp
// Environment-specific tagging
var service = builder.AddProject<Projects.Service>("service")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(context =>
    {
        return context.Environment switch
        {
            "Production" => $"prod-{GetReleaseVersion()}",
            "Staging" => $"staging-{GetBuildNumber()}",
            "Development" => $"dev-{DateTime.UtcNow:yyyyMMdd}",
            _ => "latest"
        };
    });

// Multi-resource coordination
var sharedVersion = await GetSharedVersionAsync();

var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(() => $"frontend-{sharedVersion}");

var backend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Backend>("backend")
    .WithDeploymentImageTag(() => $"backend-{sharedVersion}");
```
