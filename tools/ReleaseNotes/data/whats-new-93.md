## 🖥️ App model enhancements

### ✨ Zero-friction container configuration

Many container integrations now expose **first-class helpers** to set ports, usernames, and passwords without digging through internal properties.
All three settings can be supplied **securely via parameters**, keeping secrets out of source:

```csharp
var pgPwd = builder.AddParameter("pg-pwd", secret: true);

builder.AddPostgres("pg")
       .WithHostPort(6045)          // choose the host-side port
       .WithPassword(pgPwd)         // reference a secret parameter
```

The new `WithHostPort`, `WithPassword`, and `WithUserName` (or equivalent per-service) extension methods are available on **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**, **Redis**, and several other container resources, giving you consistent, declarative control across the stack.

### 🔗 Streamlined custom URLs

9.3 makes resource links both **smarter** and **easier** to place:

- **Pick where a link appears** – each link now carries a `UrlDisplayLocation` (`SummaryAndDetails` or `DetailsOnly`), so you can keep diagnostic links out of the main grid yet still see them in the details pane.
- **Relative paths are auto-resolved** – hand the helper `"/health"` and Aspire rewrites it to the full host-qualified URL when the endpoint is allocated.
- **Multiple links per endpoint** – an overload of `WithUrlForEndpoint` lets you attach extra URLs (docs, admin UIs, probes) to the same endpoint without redefining it.
- **Endpoint helper inside callbacks** – `context.GetEndpoint("https")` fetches the fully-resolved endpoint so you can build custom links programmatically.
- **Custom URLs for any resource** – `WithUrl*` also works for custom resources.

```csharp
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")

    // Hide the plain-HTTP link from the Resources grid
    .WithUrlForEndpoint("http",
        url => url.DisplayLocation = UrlDisplayLocation.DetailsOnly)

    // Add an extra link under the HTTPS endpoint that points to /health
    .WithUrlForEndpoint("https", ep => new()
    {
        Url            = "/health",                  // relative path supported
        DisplayText    = "Health",
        DisplayLocation = UrlDisplayLocation.DetailsOnly
    });
```

With these tweaks you can further customize your local dev stack by surfacing the right links in the right place.

### 🙈 Hide resources without "faking" their state

Historically the only way to keep a resource out of the Dashboard was to put it in the **`Hidden`** *state*—a hack that also made the resource look "terminal" to APIs such as `WaitForResourceAsync`. In 9.3 every snapshot now carries a **boolean `IsHidden` flag**, completely decoupling *visibility* from *lifecycle state*.

- **Cleaner defaults** – low-level helpers like `AddParameter` and `AddConnectionString` mark themselves hidden so they don't clutter the UI:

  ```csharp
  var apiKey = builder.AddParameter("api-key", secret: true);   // IsHidden = true ✔
  ```

- **Accurate waits & health flows** – `WaitForResourceAsync` was updated to treat `IsHidden` as a separate predicate, so hidden resources can still be awaited or surfaced programmatically without special-casing states.

This small change removes ambiguity in the model while giving you precise control over what shows up in the Dashboard.

### 🔔 New lifecycle events

.NET Aspire 9.3 introduces two new lifecycle events that make it easier to build custom resources with predictable behavior—without relying on hacks like <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Run*?displayProperty=nameWithType> or polling:

#### `InitializeResourceEvent`

This event fires **after a resource is added**, but **before endpoints are allocated**. It's especially useful for custom resources that don't have a built-in lifecycle (like containers or executables), giving you a clean place to kick off background logic, set default state, or wire up behavior.

For example, this minimal custom resource publishes a running state when initialized:

```csharp
var myCustom = new MyCustomResource("my-resource");

builder.AddResource(myCustom);
builder.Eventing.Subscribe<InitializeResourceEvent>(myCustom, async (e, ct) =>
{
    await e.Notifications.PublishUpdateAsync(e.Resource,
        s => s with { State = KnownResourceStates.Running });
});
```

This replaces awkward patterns like `Task.Run` inside constructors or `Configure()` methods. You can see a more complex version in the [TalkingClock sample](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/tree/3dee8cd7c7880fe421ea61ba167301eb1369000a/samples/CustomResources/CustomResources.AppHost) in the official Aspire samples repo.

#### `ResourceEndpointsAllocatedEvent`

This event fires once a resource's endpoints have been assigned (e.g., after port resolution or container allocation). It's scoped per resource, so you can safely get an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.EndpointReference> and build derived URLs or diagnostics.

```csharp
builder.Eventing.Subscribe<ResourceEndpointsAllocatedEvent>((e, ct) =>
{
    if (e.Resource is IResourceWithEndpoints resource)
    {
        var http = resource.GetEndpoint("http");

        Console.WriteLine($"Endpoint http - Allocated {http.IsAllocated}, Port: {http.Port}");
    }

    return Task.CompletedTask;
});
```

These events make resource authoring smoother, safer, and more deterministic—no lifecycle guesswork needed.

### 🌐 YARP Integration (Preview)

.NET Aspire 9.3 introduces **preview support for [YARP](https://aka.ms/yarp)** (Yet Another Reverse Proxy)—a long-requested addition that brings reverse proxying into the Aspire application model.

This integration makes it easy to add a lightweight proxy container to your distributed app, powered by the official [YARP container image](https://yarp.dot.net). It currently supports **configuration-based routing only**, using a JSON file you supply.

#### Add a reverse proxy to your Aspire app:

```csharp
builder.AddYarp("apigateway")
       .WithConfigFile("yarp.json")
       .WithReference(basketService)
       .WithReference(catalogService);
```

The config file is mounted into the container and used as the runtime YARP configuration.

#### Example _yarp.json_:

```json
{
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      "catalog": {
        "ClusterId": "catalog",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/catalog/{**catch-all}"
        }
      },
      "basket": {
        "ClusterId": "basket",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/basket/{**catch-all}"
        }
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      "catalog": {
        "Destinations": {
          "catalog/d1": {
            "Address": "http://catalog/"
          }
        }
      },
      "basket": {
        "Destinations": {
          "basket/d1": {
            "Address": "http://basket/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `.WithReference(...)` calls automatically ensure that the proxy container can resolve the referenced services by name (`catalog`, `basket`), using Aspire's internal network graph.

#### ⚠️ Known limitations in this preview

- **Only configuration-based routing is supported**. Code-based or programmatic route generation is not available yet.
- **The configuration file is not deployed** as part of publish operations—you must manage the file manually.
- **Routing from containers to projects will not work on Podman**, due to host-to-container networking limitations.

### 🐬 MySQL `AddDatabase` now creates the database

In .NET Aspire 9.3, the MySQL integration now supports **automatic database creation** via the `AddDatabase` API—matching the behavior already available for SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

Previously, calling `.AddDatabase("dbname")` on a MySQL resource only created a logical reference in Aspire's app model—it did **not** create the database on the server. This mismatch caused confusion, especially when users expected Aspire to provision the database like it does for other integrations.

#### ✅ New behavior in 9.3:

```csharp
var mysql = builder.AddMySql("db");

mysql.AddDatabase("appdb");
```

At runtime, Aspire now executes a `CREATE DATABASE` command for `"appdb"` against the running MySQL container or server. If the database already exists, the command is skipped safely.

This brings MySQL in line with the broader Aspire database ecosystem:

| Integration | Automatically creates database?           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SQL Server  | ✅ Yes                                    |
| PostgreSQL  | ✅ Yes                                    |
| **MySQL**   | ✅ **Yes (new in 9.3)**                   |
| MongoDB     | ❌ No (not needed; created on first write) |
| Oracle      | ❌ No (not supported yet)                 |

No additional configuration is required—the same `AddDatabase` call you already use now provisions the database for you behind the scenes.

## 📊 Dashboard delights

### ✨ GitHub Copilot in the dashboard

Introducing GitHub Copilot in the .NET Aspire dashboard! GitHub Copilot is your new AI debugging assistant.

GitHub Copilot supercharges the dashboard's OpenTelemetry debugging and diagnostics experience. With AI, you can:

- Review hundreds of log messages with a single click
- Investigate the root cause of errors across multiple apps
- Highlight performance issues in traces
- Explain obscure error codes using AI's huge knowledge repository

You'll have access to Copilot in the dashboard when you launch your app from VS Code or Visual Studio.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-copilot.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard with GitHub Copilot chat open.":::

For more details on requirements and how to get started, see [GitHub Copilot in the .NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/copilot.md).

### 🧠 Remembers your filter settings

The .NET Aspire dashboard now **remembers your resource filter settings** between sessions. Previously, if you filtered the Resources view (for example, to hide support services or highlight only frontend apps), those filters were reset on page reload.

As of 9.3, filter state is **persisted in local storage**, so your selections stick across refreshes and restarts. This small improvement makes it easier to focus on the parts of your app that matter most—especially in large graphs with many supporting services like Redis, SQL, or queues.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-filter.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard resource's page showing the filter popup.":::

### 🧵 Uninstrumented resources now appear in Traces

In 9.3, the dashboard can now **visualize outgoing calls to resources that don't emit their own telemetry**—such as databases, caches, and other infrastructure components that lack built-in tracing.

Previously, these dependencies were invisible in the **Traces** view unless they were emitting OTLP traces. Now, if your app makes an HTTP, SQL, or Redis call to a **modeled Aspire resource** that doesn't emit spans itself, Aspire still shows it as a **referenced peer** in the trace timeline.

This helps you:

- Understand the full chain of dependencies—even if some components are passive
- Debug latency or failures in calls to uninstrumented services
- Keep the trace UI consistent across infrastructure types

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 💡 This is especially useful for services like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, or blob storage where outgoing client telemetry exists, but the service itself doesn't participate in distributed tracing.

🧪 No instrumentation changes are needed—Aspire infers the mapping based on resource references.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-traces-uninstrumented-resources.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-traces-uninstrumented-resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard traces's page showing added resources in results.":::

### 🖱️ Resource context menus & quick-launch actions

.NET Aspire 9.3 makes the dashboard more interactive and easier to navigate by introducing new **context menus** and enhancing how **resource URLs** are surfaced across views.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-context-menu.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-context-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard resource graph view with a context menu.":::

#### 🧭 Right-click context menus in the graph

You can now **right-click any resource node** in the **Resource Graph** view to bring up a context menu with quick actions:

- Open structured logs, console logs, traces, or metrics for that resource
- Launch external URLs associated with the resource (like PGAdmin, Swagger, or Grafana)
- Jump directly to the resource's detail pane

This reduces the number of clicks and lets you stay in the graph while investigating specific services.

#### 🔗 Resource URLs in console log actions

Resource URLs defined via `WithUrlForEndpoint(...)` are now **more prominently integrated** into the dashboard UI. They appear:

- In the **console logs view** action bar
- In the new **right-click menus**
- On the **resource detail pane**, as before

This makes common destinations—like admin UIs, health checks, and docs—instantly accessible wherever you're working.

Together, these improvements turn the Aspire dashboard into a true control plane for navigating your distributed app—**less friction, more focus.**

### ⏸️ Metrics pause warning

The dashboard now shows a **warning banner** when metrics collection is paused. This makes it clear that data may be stale if you've temporarily halted telemetry.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-metrics-warning.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-metrics-warning.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard metrics page with a pause warning.":::

### 📝 Friendly names in console logs

When a resource has only **one replica**, the Aspire dashboard now uses the **friendly resource name** (like `frontend`, `apigateway`, or `redis`) instead of the replica ID (like `frontend-0`) in the **console logs view**.

This small change makes logs easier to read and reduces visual noise—especially in common single-instance setups during development.

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-replica scenarios, Aspire still uses full replica IDs so you can distinguish between instances.

## 🚀 Deployment & publish

### 🏗️ Improvements to in-preview publisher model & compute environment support

In 9.2, we shipped our first iteration of "publishers", a flexible way to configure deployments to any cloud in the app host. To ensure more flexibility, .NET Aspire 9.3 includes a **new and improved** publisher model that distributes publishing behavior across your application graph instead of relying on a single top-level publisher.

Rather than selecting a target environment (like Docker or Azure) by calling `AddDockerComposePublisher()` or similar, Aspire now includes a **built-in publisher** that looks for a `PublishingCallbackAnnotation` on each resource. This annotation describes how that resource should be published—for example, as a Docker Compose service, Kubernetes manifest, or Azure Bicep module.

> [!TIP]
> ✅ This architectural shift lays the groundwork for **hybrid and heterogeneous deployments**, where different services within the same app can be deployed to different targets (cloud, edge, local).

#### Most apps only need one environment

In typical apps, you only need to add a **single compute environment**, like:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env");
```

In this case, Aspire applies the correct publishing behavior to all compute resources in your app model—no extra configuration needed.

#### Multiple environments require disambiguation

If you add **multiple compute environments**, Aspire needs to know which resource goes where. Compute environments apply their transformations to **all applicable compute resources** (projects, containers, executables). If more than one environment matches a given resource, Aspire throws an **ambiguous environment exception** at publish time.

You can resolve this by using `WithComputeEnvironment(...)`:

```csharp
var k8s = builder.AddKubernetesEnvironment("k8s-env");
var compose = builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("docker-env");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
       .WithComputeEnvironment(compose);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
       .WithComputeEnvironment(k8s);
```

This (contrived) example shows how you could explicitly map services to different compute targets—modeling, for example, a frontend in Kubernetes and a backend in Docker Compose.

> [!NOTE]
> 💡 Imagine a real-world case where your frontend is deployed to a CDN or GitHub Pages, and your backend runs in Azure Container Apps. This new model makes that future possible.

⚠️ All previous publisher registration APIs (like `AddDockerComposePublisher()`) have been removed in favor of this new model.

#### Supported compute environments

.NET Aspire 9.3 has preview support for the following environment resources:

- `AddDockerComposeEnvironment(...)`
- `AddKubernetesEnvironment(...)`
- `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment(...)`
- `AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment(...)` — [see new App Service support →](#-azure-app-service-preview-support)

These represent deployment targets that can transform and emit infrastructure-specific artifacts from your app model.

### 🐳 Docker Compose enhancements

.NET Aspire 9.3 introduces powerful new capabilities for customizing Docker Compose output using strongly typed, C#-based configuration. You can now declaratively configure both the **global Compose file** and individual **services** directly from the Aspire app model—making your deployment output easy to reason about, customize, and automate.

#### 🛠️ Customize the Compose file and service definitions

You can now programmatically configure the top-level Compose file and the behavior of each individual service using two new APIs:

- `ConfigureComposeFile(...)` — customize the `docker-compose.yml` metadata
- `PublishAsDockerComposeService(...)` — modify the generated service for any compute resource (like a container or project)

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("env")
       .WithProperties(env =>
       {
           env.BuildContainerImages = false; // skip image build step
       })
       .ConfigureComposeFile(file =>
       {
           file.Name = "aspire-ai-chat"; // sets the file name
       });

// Add a container to the app
builder.AddContainer("service", "nginx")
       .WithEnvironment("ORIGINAL_ENV", "value")
       .PublishAsDockerComposeService((resource, service) =>
       {
           service.Labels["custom-label"] = "test-value";
           service.AddEnvironmentalVariable("CUSTOM_ENV", "custom-value");
           service.Restart = "always";
       });
```

These APIs give you a structured, strongly typed way to mutate the generated output—enabling richer CI automation, custom tooling, and environment-specific adjustments without editing YAML manually.

#### 🔗 Map parameters and expressions into Docker Compose

.NET Aspire now supports **binding values from the app model**—like parameters and references—into the Docker Compose definition via environment variable placeholders.

This makes it easy to flow dynamic configuration (e.g., from the CI pipeline or secret store) directly into the final output.

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("docker-compose");

var containerNameParam = builder.AddParameter("param-1", "default-name", publishValueAsDefault: true);

builder.AddContainer("service", "nginx")
       .WithEnvironment("ORIGINAL_ENV", "value")
       .PublishAsDockerComposeService((resource, service) =>
       {
           service.ContainerName = containerNameParam.AsEnvironmentPlaceholder(resource);
       });
```

The key API here is `.AsEnvironmentPlaceholder(...)`, which tells Aspire to emit a Compose variable like `${PARAM_1}` and register the mapping so the `.env` file is updated accordingly.

> [!TIP]
> 🧠 This tightly couples your infrastructure parameters with the Docker Compose model—without hardcoding values—unlocking composability across environments.

These enhancements make Docker Compose a **fully programmable publishing target**, ideal for local development, container-based CI workflows, and teams that need structured control without brittle YAML overlays.

### ☸️ Kubernetes manifest customization

.NET Aspire 9.3 adds support for **programmatically customizing generated Kubernetes manifests** as part of the publish process. This gives you fine-grained control over the YAML artifacts Aspire emits—without writing raw manifest overlays or patches.

Like Docker Compose, Aspire now supports both **global environment-level settings** and **per-resource customization**.

#### 🛠️ Configure global and per-resource settings

You can use the following APIs to configure Kubernetes output in C#:

- `WithProperties(...)` on the compute environment to set global behaviors
- `PublishAsKubernetesService(...)` on compute resources to modify their specific Kubernetes resources

```csharp
builder.AddKubernetesEnvironment("env")
       .WithProperties(env =>
       {
           env.DefaultImagePullPolicy = "Always"; // e.g., Always, IfNotPresent
       });

builder.AddContainer("service", "nginx")
       .WithEnvironment("ORIGINAL_ENV", "value")
       .PublishAsKubernetesService(resource =>
       {
           // Add custom deployment-level settings
           resource.Deployment!.Spec.RevisionHistoryLimit = 5;
       });
```

This gives you fully typed access to the Kubernetes object model, enabling powerful modifications like:

- Overriding container image pull policies
- Customizing replica counts or deployment strategies
- Injecting labels or annotations into Services, Deployments, or ConfigMaps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🧠 Aspire emits standard Kubernetes manifests under the hood—you can still use `kubectl`, `helm`, or GitOps workflows to deploy them, but now you can shape them directly from your app definition.

## 🖥️ Aspire CLI enhancements

🧪 The Aspire CLI is **still in preview** and under active development. Expect more features and polish in future releases.

📦 To install:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global aspire.cli --prerelease
```

> [!NOTE]
> ⚠️ **The Aspire 9.3 CLI is not compatible with Aspire 9.2 projects.**
> You must upgrade your project to Aspire 9.3+ in order to use the latest CLI features.

#### 🔍 Smarter app host discovery

The CLI now **walks upward** from your current directory, **recursively searching each level** for the app host project. Once located, it caches the result in a `.aspire` folder to speed up future commands.

You can now run commands like `aspire run`, `aspire add`, or `aspire publish` from **any directory within your solution**, and the CLI will resolve the app host automatically.

For example:

```bash
cd src/frontend
aspire run
```

#### ⏳ Health-aware dashboard launch

The CLI now **waits for the dashboard to become responsive** before printing its URL to the terminal. This ensures the link works immediately when opened—no more blank pages or retry loops.

These updates make the Aspire CLI more reliable, script-friendly, and aligned with how developers move across folders and projects during daily development.

## ☁️ Azure goodies

### 🌐 Azure App Service (Preview support)

.NET Aspire 9.3 introduces **preview support for deploying .NET projects to Azure App Service**—one of the most requested features from developers using Aspire with existing Azure environments.

This integration lets you deploy your project as a **containerized Linux Web App**, modeled directly in your Aspire app host using a new `AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment(...)` API.

#### 🚧 Current limitations (Preview)

This first release is scoped to the most common use cases:

- Supports **.NET projects only** (via `AddProject(...)`)
- Each project must expose a **single public HTTP endpoint**
- **Projects are published as containers** to Azure Container Registry
- **Containers within the app host** are not supported
- **Existing App Service Plans are not supported**
- The Aspire **dashboard is not hosted** in App Service yet

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 📢 Hosted dashboard support is coming soon—we're actively developing this. Feedback is welcome!

#### Example: Deploy to Azure App Service

```csharp
builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("env");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
       .PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, site) =>
       {
           site.SiteConfig.IsWebSocketsEnabled = true;
       });
```

In this example:

- Aspire provisions an App Service Plan and a Web App
- Your project is built as a container and published to **Azure Container Registry**
- The container is deployed to App Service with the configuration you provide

> 🧠 Use `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite(...)` to customize settings like site config, authentication, or SKU.

💬 This feature is in **preview**—we're looking for your feedback as we expand support!

### 📤 Use an existing Azure Container Registry (ACR)

.NET Aspire 9.3 adds support for modeling an existing **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** using the new `AddAzureContainerRegistry(...)` API. This enables you to **push images to an ACR you already manage**—without Aspire provisioning a new one.

This is ideal for teams that:

- Share a centralized registry across environments
- Integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines and promotion workflows
- Require fine-grained control over image publishing

#### Example: associate ACR with an Azure Container Apps environment

```csharp
var acr = builder.AddAzureContainerRegistry("my-acr");

builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env")
       .WithAzureContainerRegistry(acr);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();
```

In this example:

- The ACR is modeled in Aspire and used by the container apps environment
- Aspire publishes the built image to `my-acr` and configures Azure Container Apps to pull from it

#### ACR works with multiple compute environments

You can associate an `AzureContainerRegistryResource` with:

- `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment(...)`
- `AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment(...)`

This gives you consistent control over where images are published, even across different compute targets.

> 💡 Use `.RunAsExisting()` or `.PublishAsExisting()` on the ACR resource to reference an existing registry without provisioning one.

### 🖇️ Resource Deep Linking for Blob Containers

.NET Aspire 9.3 expands **resource deep linking** to include **Azure Blob Storage containers**, building on the model already used for Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, Service Bus, and Azure OpenAI.

You can now model individual blob containers directly in your app host, then inject scoped `BlobContainerClient` instances into your services—making it easy to read or write blobs without manually configuring connection strings or access.

**AppHost:**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add Azure Storage Emulator
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage").RunAsEmulator();

// Add a blob group and a container
var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");
var container = blobs.AddBlobContainer("images", blobContainerName: "image-uploads");

// Add the API project and reference the container
builder.AddProject<Projects.my94app_ApiService>("api")
       .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
       .WithReference(container);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**In the API project:**

```csharp
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register the blob container client
builder.AddAzureBlobContainerClient("images");

var app = builder.Build();

// Minimal POST endpoint for image upload
app.MapPost("/upload", async (
    IFormFile file,
    BlobContainerClient container) =>
{
    await container.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

    var blob = container.GetBlobClient(file.FileName);
    using var stream = file.OpenReadStream();
    await blob.UploadAsync(stream, overwrite: true);

    return Results.Ok(new { Url = blob.Uri });
});

app.Run();
```

This pattern provides clean separation of concerns, secure container scoping, and minimal ceremony—ideal for microservices that interact with specific blob containers.

### 🔐 Expanded Azure Key Vault client integrations

.NET Aspire 9.3 expands Azure Key Vault support with new client integration APIs for **keys** and **certificates**, allowing you to inject typed Azure SDK clients directly into your services:

- `AddAzureKeyVaultKeyClient(...)`
- `AddAzureKeyVaultCertificateClient(...)`
- `AddKeyedAzureKeyVaultKeyClient(...)`
- `AddKeyedAzureKeyVaultCertificateClient(...)`

These APIs complement the existing `AddAzureKeyVaultClient(...)` and provide easy access to `KeyClient` and `CertificateClient` from the Azure SDK for .NET.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register default clients
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultKeyClient("kv");
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultCertificateClient("kv");

// Register named (keyed) clients
builder.AddKeyedAzureKeyVaultCertificateClient("kv", "signing-cert");
```

The **keyed overloads** allow you to register multiple clients scoped to the same Key Vault resource—useful when accessing multiple certificates or keys by purpose.

### 🔑 Use Key Vault secrets in environment variables

.NET Aspire 9.3 adds support for wiring **Key Vault secrets directly into environment variables** using a new overload of `WithEnvironment(...)` that accepts an `IAzureKeyVaultSecretReference`.

This makes it easy to securely reference secrets from a modeled Key Vault without hardcoding secret values—and ensures those references flow correctly into deployment outputs like Azure Bicep.

```csharp
var kv = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("myKeyVault");

var secretRef = kv.Resource.GetSecret("mySecret");

builder.AddContainer("myContainer", "nginx")
       .WithEnvironment("MY_SECRET", secretRef);
```

#### 🧩 Reference secrets from existing Key Vaults

You can also use this with **existing Azure Key Vaults** by marking the resource with `AsExisting(...)`, `RunAsExisting(...)`, or `PublishAsExisting(...)`. This lets you consume secrets from **already-provisioned vaults**—perfect for shared environments or team-managed infrastructure.

```csharp
var keyVaultNameParam = builder.AddParameter("key-vault-name");
var keyVaultResourceGroupParam = builder.AddParameter("key-vault-rg");

var existingVault = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("sharedVault")
                           .AsExisting(keyVaultNameParam, keyVaultResourceGroupParam);

var apiKey = existingVault.Resource.GetSecret("stripe-api-key");

builder.AddContainer("billing", "mycompany/billing")
       .WithEnvironment("STRIPE_API_KEY", apiKey);
```

This pattern ensures Aspire:

- Doesn't attempt to re-provision the Key Vault
- Emits references to the correct existing resources in publish mode
- Still enables secret injection and secure scoping via environment variables

### 🧠 Azure AI Inference client integration (Preview)

.NET Aspire 9.3 adds **client-only support for Azure-hosted Chat Completions endpoints** using the <xref:Azure.AI.Inference> library and the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.AI> abstractions.

This integration simplifies calling Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Inference services from your application—whether you prefer working directly with the SDK or using abstraction-friendly interfaces.

#### Use `ChatCompletionsClient` with the Azure SDK

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("connectionName");

app.MapPost("/chat-raw", (
    ChatCompletionsClient client,
    ChatRequest message) =>
{
    // Use the client
});
```

#### Use `IChatClient` via `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("inference")
       .AddChatClient();
```

Once registered, you can inject <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient> using standard dependency injection:

```csharp
app.MapPost("/chat", async (
    IChatClient chatClient,
    ChatRequest message) =>
{
    var result = await chatClient.GetResponseAsync(message.Input);
    return result;
});
```

This setup integrates seamlessly with frameworks like [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), and works well in modular or pluggable AI systems.

### ⚙️ Azure App Configuration client integration

.NET Aspire 9.3 adds support for **Azure App Configuration** via a new client integration, [📦 Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration) NuGet package.

This makes it easy to connect to centralized configuration using the official Azure SDK and the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration` provider—no manual setup required.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration("appconfig");
```

Once registered, Aspire automatically wires Azure App Configuration into your application's configuration pipeline.

#### Example: bind Azure App Configuration to app settings

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration("appconfig");

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/feature", (IConfiguration config) =>
{
    var isEnabled = config.GetValue<bool>("FeatureFlag:Enabled");
    return Results.Ok(new { Enabled = isEnabled });
});

app.Run();
```

This enables:

- Dynamic feature flag evaluation
- Centralized configuration management across environments
- Secure integration into the Aspire hosting model

> 🔐 Like all Azure integrations in Aspire, the App Configuration client defaults to using **Managed Identity** for secure access—no connection strings required.

📦 NuGet package: [`Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration)

### 🛡️ Secure multi-app access to Azure SQL (Breaking change)

In .NET Aspire 9.2, using **multiple projects with the same Azure SQL Server** inside an **Azure Container Apps environment** could silently break your app's identity model.

Each app was assigned its own **managed identity**, but Aspire granted **admin access** to the last app deployed—overwriting access for any previously deployed apps. This led to confusing failures where only one app could talk to the database at a time.

#### ✅ New behavior in 9.3

.NET Aspire 9.3 fixes this by:

1. Assigning **one identity** as the **SQL Server administrator**
2. Emitting a **SQL script** that:

   - Creates a **user** for each additional managed identity
   - Assigns each user the **`db_owner`** role on the target database

This ensures every app that references the database gets **full access** without conflicting with other apps.

#### Why this matters

- Supports **multiple apps accessing the same SQL Server** securely
- Preserves **least-privilege separation** across app identities
- Avoids the brittle “last one wins” admin behavior from earlier releases
- Enables richer deployment scenarios in cloud-native environments like Azure Container Apps

#### ⚠️ Breaking change

If your deployment relied on Aspire setting the managed identity as the SQL Server **admin**, you'll need to review your access model. Apps now receive **explicit role-based access (`db_owner`)** instead of broad admin rights.

### 💸 Default Azure SQL SKU now uses the Free Offer (Breaking change)

.NET Aspire 9.3 changes the default SKU used when provisioning **Azure SQL databases** to the **GP_S_Gen5_2** (General Purpose Serverless) tier with the [**Free Offer**](/azure/azure-sql/database/free-offer?view=azuresql). This helps reduce unexpected costs during development and experimentation.

Previously, Aspire defaulted to the **General Purpose (GP)** tier *without* the Free Offer, which could incur charges even for small or test apps.

#### What's new

When you provision a SQL database like this:

```csharp
var sql = builder.AddAzureSqlServer("sqlserver");

sql.AddDatabase("appdb");
```

Aspire now automatically uses the **Free Offer** for `appdb`, which will deploy a **GP_S_Gen5_2** (General Purpose Serverless), unless you override it.

#### How to restore the previous behavior

If your app requires the performance or features of the General Purpose paid tier, you can opt out of the new default using:

```csharp
sql.AddDatabase("appdb")
   .WithDefaultAzureSku(); // Uses the previous (General Purpose) default
```

If you want to specify what SKU to use, you the `ConfigureInfrastructure` method as explained here: [Setting a specific SKU](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/tree/main/src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Sql#setting-a-specific-sku).

#### ⚠️ Breaking change

This change affects cost, performance, and available features in new deployments. If your app depends on higher-tier capabilities, be sure to configure the SKU accordingly.

🔧 Use `.WithDefaultAzureSku()` on the **database** to revert to the old behavior

## 🚀 AZD: Major Improvements to CI/CD for Aspire Apps

We've dramatically improved how `azd` configures CI/CD pipelines for Aspire-based applications. These updates directly address one of the most frustrating pain points reported by the community: managing environment parameters and secrets securely and predictably across environments.

Aspire apps are increasingly parameter-driven — using infrastructure-defined settings like connection strings, runtime versions, API keys, and feature flags. Getting those values safely and consistently into CI pipelines like GitHub Actions has historically been difficult. This release fixes that.

### 🧠 Smarter Parameter Handling — No More `AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG`

Previously, Aspire apps that required infrastructure parameters relied on a hidden environment variable called `AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG`. This variable was a large JSON blob containing all local environment configuration. It had to be passed manually into CI pipelines, was difficult to inspect, and introduced friction when sharing or updating environments.

**Now:** `azd` extracts Aspire parameters directly from your infrastructure definitions and exposes them as named environment variables or secrets in your pipeline — **securely and explicitly**.

For example:

```bicep
param openaiKey string
param dbPassword string
```

become:

```yaml
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY }}
AZURE_DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.AZURE_DB_PASSWORD }}
```

This means no more bundling, no more fragile config hacks, and no more guessing how your environment is configured in CI.

### 🔤 Consistent, Predictable Parameter Naming

Aspire parameters are mapped to environment variable names using a clear rule:

1. Convert `camelCase` to `SNAKE_CASE`
2. Replace dashes (`-`) with underscores (`_`)
3. Uppercase everything
4. Prefix with `AZURE_`

| Parameter name         | Env var vame                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `openaiKey`            | `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`           |
| `dbPassword`           | `AZURE_DB_PASSWORD`          |
| `storage-account-name` | `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` |

This naming consistency means Aspire deployment targets like Azure Container Apps can resolve configuration without custom mappings — locally or in the cloud.

### 📦 Aspire Parameters Automatically Exported to CI

Aspire apps often define required parameters in Bicep or infrastructure modules — including things like API keys, credentials, or runtime configuration. These are now automatically exported to your pipeline configuration using the naming rules above.

You no longer need to:

- Manually configure these in _.azure/env-name/config.json_
- Inject them into CI via complex JSON blobs
- Worry about missing or mismatched configuration between local and cloud

Secure parameters (like `openaiKey` or `dbPassword`) are automatically treated as CI secrets, while others are injected as variables — all handled by `azd`.

### 🧼 Interactive Secret Management in GitHub Actions

When you run `azd pipeline config`, `azd` will now detect and prompt you if a secret already exists in your GitHub repo or if a secret is no longer used:

#### Existing Secret Prompt:

```text
The secret AZURE_OPENAI_KEY already exists. What would you like to do?
  [1] Keep it
  [2] Keep ALL existing secrets
  [3] Overwrite it
  [4] Overwrite ALL secrets
```

#### Unused Secret Prompt:

```text
The secret AZURE_OLD_SECRET is no longer used. What would you like to do?
  [1] Keep it
  [2] Keep ALL unused secrets
  [3] Delete it
  [4] Delete ALL unused secrets
```

This ensures:

- You're never surprised by secret overwrites
- You can keep your repo clean of stale configuration
- CI reflects your actual infrastructure setup

### 🔄 End-to-End, Repeatable Aspire Deployment

With these changes, the local-to-cloud workflow for Aspire apps is now consistent and automated:

1. You define infrastructure parameters as part of your Aspire app.
2. `azd` captures them during provisioning.
3. `azd pipeline config` maps them into your GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline.
4. Your pipeline runs securely with all the same inputs as your local environment — no manual steps required.

No more `AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG`. No more brittle overrides. Just clear, secure, parameterized deployment.

These changes unlock a smoother, safer CI/CD experience for Aspire projects — reducing manual configuration, improving security, and aligning your local development setup with your production pipeline.
