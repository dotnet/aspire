# GitHub Actions Failure Analysis Tools

This directory contains tools for analyzing and diagnosing GitHub Actions test failures.

## DownloadFailingJobLogs.cs

A .NET file-based program that automatically downloads logs and artifacts for failed GitHub Actions jobs.

### What it does

This tool helps you quickly investigate GitHub Actions test failures by:

1. **Finding all failed jobs** in a GitHub Actions workflow run
2. **Downloading job logs** for each failed job
3. **Extracting test failures and errors** from the logs using regex patterns
4. **Determining artifact names** from job names based on the workflow's naming convention
5. **Downloading test artifacts** containing .trx files and test logs
6. **Extracting artifacts** to local directories for inspection

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK or later
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Access to the dotnet/aspire repository (or appropriate permissions for your target repo)

### Usage

Run the tool by passing a GitHub Actions run ID:

```bash
dotnet tools/scripts/DownloadFailingJobLogs.cs <run-id>
```

**Example:**
```bash
dotnet tools/scripts/DownloadFailingJobLogs.cs 19846215629
```

You can find the run ID from the GitHub Actions URL:
```
https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/actions/runs/19846215629
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
                                                  run ID
```

### Output

The tool creates the following files in your current directory:

- **`failed_job_<n>_<job-name>.log`** - Raw job logs from GitHub Actions
- **`artifact_<n>_<testname>_<os>.zip`** - Downloaded artifact zip files
- **`artifact_<n>_<testname>_<os>/`** - Extracted artifact directories containing:
  - `.trx` test result files
  - Test logs
  - Build binary logs (`.binlog`)
  - DCP (Distributed Application) diagnostic logs

### Example Output

```

### How it works

1. **Job Discovery**: Uses `gh api` to query all jobs in the workflow run with manual pagination to handle 200+ artifacts
2. **Failure Detection**: Filters jobs by `conclusion == "failure"`
3. **Log Download**: Downloads raw logs for each failed job via the GitHub API
4. **Error Extraction**: Uses regex patterns to find:
   - Failed test names
   - Error messages
   - Exception stack traces
5. **Artifact Matching**: Parses job names to determine the artifact name using the pattern `logs-{testShortName}-{os}`
6. **Artifact Download**: Downloads the matching artifact containing test results
7. **Extraction**: Uses `System.IO.Compression.ZipFile` to extract artifacts

### Technical Details

- **Language**: C# 9.0+ (file-based program)
- **Runtime**: .NET 10
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `System.IO.Compression` - For extracting zip artifacts
  - `System.Text.Json` - For parsing GitHub API responses
  - `System.Text.RegularExpressions` - For extracting test failures
- **GitHub API**: Uses `gh api` command-line tool for authenticated API access

### Troubleshooting

**No failed jobs found:**
- Verify the run ID is correct
- Check that the workflow run actually has failed jobs
- Ensure you have access to the repository

**Artifact not found:**
- The artifact may have expired (GitHub Actions artifacts are typically retained for 90 days)
- The job may not have uploaded an artifact (e.g., if it failed before tests ran)

**Permission denied:**
- Ensure you're authenticated with `gh auth login`
- Verify you have read access to the repository
