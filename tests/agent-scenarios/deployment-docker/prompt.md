# Deployment Docker Scenario

This scenario tests the end-to-end workflow of creating an Aspire application, adding Docker Compose integration, and deploying it using `aspire deploy`.

## Overview

This test validates that:
1. The Aspire CLI from the PR build can be successfully acquired
2. A new Aspire starter application can be created
3. The Docker Compose integration can be added using `aspire add`
4. The AppHost can be updated to configure Docker Compose environment
5. The `aspire publish` command generates valid Docker Compose files
6. The `aspire deploy` command successfully deploys the application

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Docker installed and running
- Docker Compose CLI available (verify with `docker compose version`)
- Sufficient disk space for the Aspire CLI and application artifacts
- Network access to download NuGet packages

**Note**: The .NET SDK is not required as a prerequisite - the Aspire CLI will install it automatically.

## Step 1: Install the Aspire CLI from the PR Build

The first step is to acquire the Aspire CLI from this PR build. The aspire-playground repository includes comprehensive instructions for acquiring different versions of the CLI, including PR builds.

**Follow the CLI acquisition instructions already provided in the aspire-playground repository to obtain the native AOT build of the CLI for this PR.**

Once acquired, verify the CLI is installed correctly:

```bash
aspire --version
```

Expected output should show the version matching the PR build.

## Step 2: Create a New Aspire Starter Application

Create a new Aspire application using the starter template. The application will be created in the current git workspace.

### 2.1 Run the Aspire New Command

Use the `aspire new` command to create a starter application:

```bash
aspire new
```

**Follow the interactive prompts:**
1. When prompted for a template, select the **"Aspire Starter App"** (template short name: `aspire-starter`)
2. Provide a name for the application when prompted (suggestion: `AspireDockerTest`)
3. Accept the default target framework (should be .NET 10.0)
4. Select Blazor as the frontend technology
5. Choose a test framework (suggestion: xUnit)

### 2.2 Verify Project Structure

After creation, verify the project structure:

```bash
ls -la
```

Expected structure:
- `AspireDockerTest.sln` - Solution file
- `AspireDockerTest.AppHost/` - The Aspire AppHost project
- `AspireDockerTest.ServiceDefaults/` - Shared service defaults
- `AspireDockerTest.ApiService/` - Backend API service
- `AspireDockerTest.Web/` - Blazor frontend
- `AspireDockerTest.Tests/` - Test project

## Step 3: Add Docker Compose Integration

Add the Docker Compose integration package to the AppHost project using the `aspire add` command.

### 3.1 Run the Aspire Add Command

From the workspace directory, run:

```bash
aspire add
```

**Important**: The `aspire add` command will present an interactive menu with a long list of available integrations. You will need to scroll down through the list to find the Docker Compose integration.

**Follow the interactive prompts:**
1. The command will search for available Aspire integration packages
2. A list of integrations will be displayed
3. **Hint**: The list of integrations is long and may require you to use the down arrow key (â†“) or cursor navigation to scroll through the options
4. Navigate through the list to find **"Aspire.Hosting.Docker"** or a similar name for Docker Compose integration
5. Select the Docker Compose/Docker hosting integration
6. Accept the latest version when prompted (or press Enter to accept default)

The command should output a success message indicating that the package was added to the AppHost project.

### 3.2 Verify Package Installation

Verify the package was added by checking the AppHost project file:

```bash
cat AspireDockerTest.AppHost/AspireDockerTest.AppHost.csproj
```

You should see a `<PackageReference>` for `Aspire.Hosting.Docker` with the version number.

## Step 4: Update AppHost Code

Update the AppHost Program.cs file to configure the Docker Compose environment.

### 4.1 View Current AppHost Code

First, view the current AppHost code:

```bash
cat AspireDockerTest.AppHost/Program.cs
```

### 4.2 Add Docker Compose Environment Configuration

Edit the Program.cs file to add the Docker Compose environment. Add the following line before the `builder.Build()` call:

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("compose");
```

The complete Program.cs should look similar to this:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireDockerTest_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireDockerTest_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(apiService);

// Add Docker Compose environment
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("compose");

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Note**: The `AddDockerComposeEnvironment` method registers a Docker Compose environment that will be used when publishing the application.

### 4.3 Verify the Changes

Review the updated file to ensure the changes are correct:

```bash
cat AspireDockerTest.AppHost/Program.cs
```

## Step 5: Generate Docker Compose Files with Aspire Publish

Use the `aspire publish` command to generate Docker Compose artifacts.

### 5.1 Run Aspire Publish

From the workspace directory, run:

```bash
aspire publish -o docker-compose-output
```

**What happens:**
- The command will restore dependencies if needed
- Build the solution
- Execute the publish step which generates Docker Compose files
- Output files will be placed in the `docker-compose-output` directory

**Expected output:**
- Success message indicating publish completed
- Output directory contains generated files

### 5.2 Examine Generated Files

List the contents of the output directory:

```bash
ls -la docker-compose-output/
```

**Expected files:**
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Main Docker Compose configuration file
- Additional configuration files or scripts (may vary)

View the generated Docker Compose file:

```bash
cat docker-compose-output/docker-compose.yaml
```

**Verify the file contains:**
- Service definitions for `apiservice` and `webfrontend`
- Container image references
- Port mappings for external endpoints
- Environment variable configurations
- Network configurations

## Step 6: Deploy with Aspire Deploy

Use the `aspire deploy` command to deploy the application.

### 6.1 Run Aspire Deploy

From the workspace directory, run:

```bash
aspire deploy -o docker-compose-output
```

**What happens:**
- The command executes the deployment pipeline for Docker Compose
- Reads the generated Docker Compose configuration
- Deploys the application using the Docker Compose integration
- Manages the lifecycle of containers and services

**Expected output:**
- Success message indicating deployment completed
- Information about deployed services and their status
- No error messages

### 6.2 Verify Deployment Status

After deployment, check the status of the deployed application:

```bash
# Check if containers are running (if using Docker Compose backend)
docker ps
```

**Expected output:**
- List of running containers for the application services
- All services should be in "Up" or "running" state
- Port mappings displayed for external endpoints

**Observe the deployment:**
- Services were started successfully
- No errors in the deployment process
- Application is ready to accept requests

## Step 7: Clean Up

Stop and clean up the deployed application.

### 7.1 Stop the Application

Use the appropriate cleanup command based on the deployment method. Since `aspire deploy` was used, you may need to stop the containers manually:

```bash
# If containers were started, stop them
docker ps -a | grep AspireDockerTest
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "name=AspireDockerTest")
docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter "name=AspireDockerTest")
```

Alternatively, if Docker Compose files are in the output directory, you can use:

```bash
cd docker-compose-output
docker compose down
```

**What happens:**
- Stops all running containers
- Removes containers
- Removes networks created during deployment
- Preserves volumes unless `--volumes` flag is used

**Expected output:**
- Messages showing containers being stopped and removed
- Network removal messages
- No error messages

### 7.2 Verify Cleanup

Verify containers are removed:

```bash
docker ps -a | grep AspireDockerTest
```

**Expected output:**
- Empty list or no containers from this application

## Step 8: Final Verification Checklist

Go through this final checklist to ensure all test requirements are met:

- [ ] Aspire CLI acquired successfully from PR build
- [ ] Starter application created with all expected files
- [ ] Docker Compose integration package added via `aspire add`
- [ ] AppHost updated with `AddDockerComposeEnvironment` call
- [ ] `aspire publish` command executed successfully
- [ ] Docker Compose files generated in output directory
- [ ] `docker-compose.yaml` file contains valid service definitions
- [ ] `aspire deploy` command executed successfully
- [ ] Deployment completed without errors
- [ ] Containers are running after deployment
- [ ] Cleanup successfully stopped and removed containers

## Success Criteria

The test is considered **PASSED** if:

1. **CLI Installation**: Aspire CLI from PR build acquired successfully
2. **Project Creation**: New Aspire starter application created successfully
3. **Integration Addition**: Docker Compose integration added via `aspire add` command
4. **Code Update**: AppHost updated with Docker Compose environment configuration
5. **Publishing**: `aspire publish` generates valid Docker Compose files
6. **Deployment**: `aspire deploy` successfully deploys the application
7. **Cleanup**: Cleanup commands successfully stop and remove containers

The test is considered **FAILED** if:

- CLI installation fails
- Project creation fails or generates incomplete structure
- `aspire add` command fails to add Docker Compose integration
- `aspire publish` fails to generate Docker Compose files
- Generated Docker Compose files are invalid or incomplete
- `aspire deploy` fails to deploy the application
- Errors occur during deployment or cleanup

## Troubleshooting Tips

If issues occur during the test:

### Docker Compose Integration Not Found
- Ensure you're scrolling through the complete list in `aspire add`
- Try searching by typing "docker" when the list appears
- The integration might be named "Aspire.Hosting.Docker" or similar

### Publish Fails
- Verify the Docker Compose environment was added to AppHost Program.cs
- Check that the package reference was added to the project file
- Ensure the solution builds successfully before publishing

### Deploy Fails
- Verify Docker is running: `docker info`
- Check the generated docker-compose.yaml for syntax errors
- Ensure the `aspire publish` command completed successfully
- Review deployment logs for specific error messages
- Ensure required ports are not already in use

### Services Not Accessible
- Check container status: `docker ps`
- View container logs: `docker logs [container-name]`
- Verify port mappings in docker-compose.yaml
- Check firewall settings

## Notes for Agent Execution

When executing this scenario as an automated agent:

1. **Interactive Navigation**: Be prepared to navigate long lists in interactive prompts
2. **Port Detection**: Extract actual port numbers from `docker ps` output
3. **Timing**: Allow adequate time for Docker image pulls and container startup
4. **Validation**: Verify deployment completes successfully
5. **Cleanup**: Always run cleanup even if earlier steps fail
6. **Evidence**: Capture output from key commands for verification
