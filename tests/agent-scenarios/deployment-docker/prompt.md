# Deployment Docker Scenario

This scenario tests the end-to-end workflow of creating an Aspire application, adding Docker Compose integration, and deploying it using Docker Compose.

## Overview

This test validates that:
1. The Aspire CLI from the PR build can be successfully acquired
2. A new Aspire starter application can be created
3. The Docker Compose integration can be added using `aspire add`
4. The AppHost can be updated to configure Docker Compose environment
5. The `aspire publish` command generates valid Docker Compose files
6. The generated Docker Compose files can be used with `docker compose up`
7. The deployed application endpoints are accessible and functional

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Docker installed and running
- Docker Compose CLI available (verify with `docker compose version`)
- Sufficient disk space for the Aspire CLI and application artifacts
- Network access to download NuGet packages

**Note**: The .NET SDK is not required as a prerequisite - the Aspire CLI will install it automatically.

## Step 1: Install the Aspire CLI from the PR Build

The first step is to acquire the Aspire CLI from this PR build. The aspire-playground repository includes comprehensive instructions for acquiring different versions of the CLI, including PR builds.

**Follow the CLI acquisition instructions already provided in the aspire-playground repository to obtain the native AOT build of the CLI for this PR.**

Once acquired, verify the CLI is installed correctly:

```bash
aspire --version
```

Expected output should show the version matching the PR build.

## Step 2: Create a New Aspire Starter Application

Create a new Aspire application using the starter template. The application will be created in the current git workspace.

### 2.1 Run the Aspire New Command

Use the `aspire new` command to create a starter application:

```bash
aspire new
```

**Follow the interactive prompts:**
1. When prompted for a template, select the **"Aspire Starter App"** (template short name: `aspire-starter`)
2. Provide a name for the application when prompted (suggestion: `AspireDockerTest`)
3. Accept the default target framework (should be .NET 10.0)
4. Select Blazor as the frontend technology
5. Choose a test framework (suggestion: xUnit)

### 2.2 Verify Project Structure

After creation, verify the project structure:

```bash
ls -la
```

Expected structure:
- `AspireDockerTest.sln` - Solution file
- `AspireDockerTest.AppHost/` - The Aspire AppHost project
- `AspireDockerTest.ServiceDefaults/` - Shared service defaults
- `AspireDockerTest.ApiService/` - Backend API service
- `AspireDockerTest.Web/` - Blazor frontend
- `AspireDockerTest.Tests/` - Test project

## Step 3: Add Docker Compose Integration

Add the Docker Compose integration package to the AppHost project using the `aspire add` command.

### 3.1 Run the Aspire Add Command

From the workspace directory, run:

```bash
aspire add
```

**Important**: The `aspire add` command will present an interactive menu with a long list of available integrations. You will need to scroll down through the list to find the Docker Compose integration.

**Follow the interactive prompts:**
1. The command will search for available Aspire integration packages
2. A list of integrations will be displayed
3. **Hint**: The list of integrations is long and may require you to use the down arrow key (â†“) or cursor navigation to scroll through the options
4. Navigate through the list to find **"Aspire.Hosting.Docker"** or a similar name for Docker Compose integration
5. Select the Docker Compose/Docker hosting integration
6. Accept the latest version when prompted (or press Enter to accept default)

The command should output a success message indicating that the package was added to the AppHost project.

### 3.2 Verify Package Installation

Verify the package was added by checking the AppHost project file:

```bash
cat AspireDockerTest.AppHost/AspireDockerTest.AppHost.csproj
```

You should see a `<PackageReference>` for `Aspire.Hosting.Docker` with the version number.

## Step 4: Update AppHost Code

Update the AppHost Program.cs file to configure the Docker Compose environment.

### 4.1 View Current AppHost Code

First, view the current AppHost code:

```bash
cat AspireDockerTest.AppHost/Program.cs
```

### 4.2 Add Docker Compose Environment Configuration

Edit the Program.cs file to add the Docker Compose environment. Add the following line before the `builder.Build()` call:

```csharp
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("compose");
```

The complete Program.cs should look similar to this:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireDockerTest_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireDockerTest_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(apiService);

// Add Docker Compose environment
builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("compose");

builder.Build().Run();
```

**Note**: The `AddDockerComposeEnvironment` method registers a Docker Compose environment that will be used when publishing the application.

### 4.3 Verify the Changes

Review the updated file to ensure the changes are correct:

```bash
cat AspireDockerTest.AppHost/Program.cs
```

## Step 5: Generate Docker Compose Files with Aspire Publish

Use the `aspire publish` command to generate Docker Compose artifacts.

### 5.1 Run Aspire Publish

From the workspace directory, run:

```bash
aspire publish -o docker-compose-output
```

**What happens:**
- The command will restore dependencies if needed
- Build the solution
- Execute the publish step which generates Docker Compose files
- Output files will be placed in the `docker-compose-output` directory

**Expected output:**
- Success message indicating publish completed
- Output directory contains generated files

### 5.2 Examine Generated Files

List the contents of the output directory:

```bash
ls -la docker-compose-output/
```

**Expected files:**
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Main Docker Compose configuration file
- Additional configuration files or scripts (may vary)

View the generated Docker Compose file:

```bash
cat docker-compose-output/docker-compose.yaml
```

**Verify the file contains:**
- Service definitions for `apiservice` and `webfrontend`
- Container image references
- Port mappings for external endpoints
- Environment variable configurations
- Network configurations

## Step 6: Deploy with Docker Compose

Deploy the application using Docker Compose.

### 6.1 Navigate to Output Directory

```bash
cd docker-compose-output
```

### 6.2 Start the Application

Use `docker compose up` to start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**What happens:**
- Docker Compose reads the `docker-compose.yaml` file
- Pulls any required container images
- Creates and starts containers for all services
- Runs containers in detached mode (`-d` flag)

**Expected output:**
- Messages showing containers being created
- Services starting successfully
- No error messages

### 6.3 Verify Containers are Running

Check the status of the containers:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Expected output:**
- List of running containers
- All services should show status as "Up" or "running"
- Port mappings should be displayed

View logs to confirm services started correctly:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

## Step 7: Test the Deployed Application

Verify that the deployed application endpoints are accessible.

### 7.1 Identify Service Endpoints

From the `docker compose ps` output, identify the exposed ports for the services.

Example:
- API service might be on `http://localhost:5001`
- Web frontend might be on `http://localhost:5000`

### 7.2 Test the API Service

Test the API endpoint:

```bash
# Replace PORT with the actual port from docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:5001/weatherforecast
```

**Expected response:**
- HTTP 200 OK status
- Valid JSON response with weather data
- No error messages

### 7.3 Test the Web Frontend

Test the web frontend:

```bash
# Replace PORT with the actual port from docker compose ps
curl -I http://localhost:5000
```

**Expected response:**
- HTTP 200 OK status
- HTML content headers

Optionally, use a browser or browser automation to access the web frontend:

```bash
# If browser automation is available
# playwright-browser navigate http://localhost:5000
# playwright-browser take_screenshot --filename deployed-app.png
```

### 7.4 Verify Service Communication

If the web frontend calls the API service:
1. Access the web frontend weather page
2. Verify data is displayed from the API
3. This confirms service-to-service communication works in the Docker Compose environment

## Step 8: Clean Up

Stop and remove the deployed containers.

### 8.1 Stop the Application

From the `docker-compose-output` directory:

```bash
docker compose down
```

**What happens:**
- Stops all running containers
- Removes containers
- Removes networks created by Docker Compose
- Preserves volumes unless `--volumes` flag is used

**Expected output:**
- Messages showing containers being stopped and removed
- Network removal messages
- No error messages

### 8.2 Verify Cleanup

Verify containers are removed:

```bash
docker compose ps -a
```

**Expected output:**
- Empty list or no containers from this compose project

## Step 9: Final Verification Checklist

Go through this final checklist to ensure all test requirements are met:

- [ ] Aspire CLI acquired successfully from PR build
- [ ] Starter application created with all expected files
- [ ] Docker Compose integration package added via `aspire add`
- [ ] AppHost updated with `AddDockerComposeEnvironment` call
- [ ] `aspire publish` command executed successfully
- [ ] Docker Compose files generated in output directory
- [ ] `docker-compose.yaml` file contains valid service definitions
- [ ] `docker compose up` started all services successfully
- [ ] All containers show "Up" status in `docker compose ps`
- [ ] API service endpoint is accessible and responds correctly
- [ ] Web frontend endpoint is accessible
- [ ] Service-to-service communication works (if applicable)
- [ ] `docker compose down` cleaned up containers successfully

## Success Criteria

The test is considered **PASSED** if:

1. **CLI Installation**: Aspire CLI from PR build acquired successfully
2. **Project Creation**: New Aspire starter application created successfully
3. **Integration Addition**: Docker Compose integration added via `aspire add` command
4. **Code Update**: AppHost updated with Docker Compose environment configuration
5. **Publishing**: `aspire publish` generates valid Docker Compose files
6. **Deployment**: `docker compose up` successfully deploys the application
7. **Accessibility**: All service endpoints are accessible and respond correctly
8. **Cleanup**: `docker compose down` successfully stops and removes containers

The test is considered **FAILED** if:

- CLI installation fails
- Project creation fails or generates incomplete structure
- `aspire add` command fails to add Docker Compose integration
- `aspire publish` fails to generate Docker Compose files
- Generated Docker Compose files are invalid or incomplete
- `docker compose up` fails to start services
- Services fail to respond at their endpoints
- Errors occur during deployment or cleanup

## Troubleshooting Tips

If issues occur during the test:

### Docker Compose Integration Not Found
- Ensure you're scrolling through the complete list in `aspire add`
- Try searching by typing "docker" when the list appears
- The integration might be named "Aspire.Hosting.Docker" or similar

### Publish Fails
- Verify the Docker Compose environment was added to AppHost Program.cs
- Check that the package reference was added to the project file
- Ensure the solution builds successfully before publishing

### Docker Compose Up Fails
- Verify Docker is running: `docker info`
- Check the generated docker-compose.yaml for syntax errors
- Review Docker Compose logs: `docker compose logs`
- Ensure required ports are not already in use

### Services Not Accessible
- Check container status: `docker compose ps`
- View container logs: `docker compose logs [service-name]`
- Verify port mappings in docker-compose.yaml
- Check firewall settings

## Notes for Agent Execution

When executing this scenario as an automated agent:

1. **Interactive Navigation**: Be prepared to navigate long lists in interactive prompts
2. **Port Detection**: Extract actual port numbers from `docker compose ps` output
3. **Timing**: Allow adequate time for Docker image pulls and container startup
4. **Validation**: Perform actual HTTP requests to verify endpoints
5. **Cleanup**: Always run cleanup even if earlier steps fail
6. **Evidence**: Capture output from key commands for verification
