# Aspire.Workload.Tests

## TL;DR or How do I use this?

1. [Install the sdk+workload](#install-the-sdkworkload)
2. Run/debug the tests normally now, and they will be using the sdk

## (details) What are *workload* tests?

These tests are meant to exercise the `aspire` workload. The individual tests need to create projects from templates just like a user would, and then run, and validate them. For this we need:
    - a sdk installation with the `aspire` workload installed
    - the workload should use packs from the locally built nugets
    - and the non-workload nugets should be used from the locally built ones

### Solution (sdk+workload):

- SDK is installed with `$(SdkVersionForWorkloadTesting)` set to the version in `global.json` by default.
- The Aspire workload manifest is installed using the nuget from `artifacts/packages/*/Shipping`
- Then, with a custom `nuget.config` which points to the built nuget packages in `artifacts`, we run `dotnet workload install aspire`
    - which installs the workload using the nugets from the `artifacts` into `artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest`
- This simulates the workload being installed on a user's machine, and being independent of the aspire repo.
- At this point the sdk is usable from outside the repo by using `source /path-to-aspire-repo/dogfood.sh`
- The nuget versions for the locally built packages are like `8.0.0-dev` or `8.0.0-ci`.

### Helix

- The sdk+workload is sent to helix, and used by all the tests for creating/running projects.

## Install the sdk+workload

1. `.\build.cmd -pack` - to build all the nugets (or `./build.sh -pack`)
2. `dotnet build tests/workloads.proj /p:Configuration=<config>`
    - this will install the sdk, and the `aspire` workload using the nugets from `artifacts/packages/*/Shipping` into `artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest`
    - note: `artifacts/bin/dotnet-none` contains the sdk+aspire workload manifest but NO workload

The sdk in `artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest` is usable outside the repo at this point.

## Using the sdk+workload outside the repo

- Follow the steps to [install the sdk+workload](#install-the-sdkworkload).

- The environment needs to be set up to use this. It can be done manually with:
    - Add `/path-to-aspire-repo/artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest` to `PATH`.
    - Add `artifacts/packages/$(Configuration)/Shipping` as a nuget source for your projects, so the locally built packages can be picked up.
        - `tests/Aspire.Workload.Tests/data/nuget8.config` can be used as a template for this, or you can add it manually to your `nuget.config`
        - This `nuget8.config` uses the environment variable `BUILT_NUGETS_PATH`, so set `BUILT_NUGETS_PATH=/path-to-aspire/artifacts/packages/$(Configuration)/Shipping`

- An alternative way is to use `source /path-to-aspire-repo/dogfood.sh` on Linux/macOS.
    - Copy `tests/Aspire.Workload.Tests/data/nuget8.config nuget.config`
    - and set `BUILT_NUGETS_PATH=/path-to-aspire/artifacts/packages/$(Configuration)/Shipping`

## Inner loop tips

- The sdk+workload is never updated automatically. IOW, once installed the workload packs don't get overwritten even when the source binaries changes in `artifacts`. This may change in future.

There are three categories of nugets used by the workload:

1. `Aspire.Dashboard.Sdk.osx-arm64`, `Aspire.Hosting.Orchestration.osx-arm64`, and `Aspire.Hosting.Sdk`
    - these are installed in `artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest/packs/`
    - Once the workload is installed, these are never updated automatically, so any changes made locally won't show up in the tests

2. All the other `Aspire` nugets
    - These are not part of the workload itself, but can be referenced from the user projects.
    - When tests build a project referencing such a nuget, it gets resolved from the `artifacts`.
    - And a local tests-specific cache is used for this like `/path-to-aspire-repo/artifacts/bin/Aspire.Workload.Tests/Release/net8.0/nuget-cache-Net80`
        - this is printed at the start of the test suite run

3. Project templates installed in `artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest/template-packs`.

### Testing with local changes

- If there are changes to bits that would be part of the workload packs, then those would need to be updated (copied over) manually
- The project templates don't follow the above model though. The nuget for those need to be built, and then copied to `artifacts/bin/dotnet-latest/template-packs/aspire.projecttemplates.*.nupkg` for the changes to be usable in the tests

- For changes related to other nugets, there are a couple of options:
    1. rebuild the nuget; delete the unpacked nuget from the cache
    2. Since the cache is never automatically deleted, copy over any changed files directly in the nuget cache.

    Subsequent test runs would pick up the changes.
