# Executes quarantined tests
#
# COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS:
# - Keep the 'paths:' list in sync across tests-outerloop.yml and
#   tests-quarantine.yml
# - Validate that each path exists in the repository before adding or
#   updating the list
# - No external YAML file is usedâ€”only the workflow YAMLs themselves
#   hold the list
# - The 'paths:' filter applies only to pull_request triggers, not to
#   push triggers to main
