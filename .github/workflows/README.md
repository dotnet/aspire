# GitHub Workflows

## Quarantine/Disable Test Workflow

The `quarantine-test.yml` workflow allows repository maintainers to quarantine, unquarantine, disable, or enable tests directly from issue or PR comments.

### Commands

| Command | Description | Attribute Used |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `/quarantine-test` | Mark test(s) as quarantined (flaky) | `[QuarantinedTest]` |
| `/unquarantine-test` | Remove quarantine from test(s) | Removes `[QuarantinedTest]` |
| `/disable-test` | Disable test(s) due to an active issue | `[ActiveIssue]` |
| `/enable-test` | Re-enable previously disabled test(s) | Removes `[ActiveIssue]` |

### Syntax

```
/quarantine-test <test-name(s)> <issue-url> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
/unquarantine-test <test-name(s)> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
/disable-test <test-name(s)> <issue-url> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
/enable-test <test-name(s)> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<test-name(s)>` | Yes | One or more test method names (space-separated) |
| `<issue-url>` | For quarantine/disable | URL of the GitHub issue tracking the problem |
| `--target-pr <pr-url>` | No | Push changes to an existing PR instead of creating a new one |

### Examples

#### Quarantine a flaky test (creates new PR)
```
/quarantine-test MyTestClass.MyTestMethod https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/1234
```

#### Quarantine multiple tests
```
/quarantine-test TestMethod1 TestMethod2 TestMethod3 https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/1234
```

#### Quarantine a test and push to an existing PR
```
/quarantine-test MyTestMethod https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/1234 --target-pr https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/5678
```

#### Unquarantine a test (creates new PR)
```
/unquarantine-test MyTestClass.MyTestMethod
```

#### Unquarantine and push to an existing PR
```
/unquarantine-test MyTestMethod --target-pr https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/5678
```

#### Disable a test due to an active issue
```
/disable-test MyTestMethod https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/1234
```

#### Enable a previously disabled test
```
/enable-test MyTestMethod
```

#### Comment on a PR to push changes to that PR
When you comment on a PR (not an issue), the workflow will automatically push changes to that PR's branch instead of creating a new PR. You can override this by specifying `--target-pr`.

### Behavior

1. **Permission Check**: Only users with write access to the repository can use these commands.
2. **Processing Indicator**: The workflow adds an 👀 reaction to your comment when it starts processing.
3. **Status Comments**: The workflow posts comments to indicate:
   - ⏳ Processing started
   - ✅ Success (with link to created/updated PR)
   - ℹ️ No changes needed (test already in desired state)
   - ❌ Failure (with error details)

### Target PR Behavior

| Context | `--target-pr` specified | Result |
|---------|-------------------------|--------|
| Comment on Issue | No | Creates new PR from `main` |
| Comment on Issue | Yes | Pushes to specified PR |
| Comment on PR | No | Pushes to that PR's branch |
| Comment on PR | Yes | Pushes to specified PR (overrides) |

### Restrictions

- The `--target-pr` URL must be from the same repository
- Cannot push to PRs from forks
- Cannot push to closed PRs
- The PR branch must not be protected in a way that prevents pushes

### Concurrency

The workflow uses concurrency groups based on the issue/PR number to prevent race conditions when multiple commands are issued on the same issue.
