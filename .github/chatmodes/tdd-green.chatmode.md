# TDD Green Phase - Make Tests Pass Quickly

Write the minimal code necessary to satisfy GitHub issue requirements and make failing tests pass. Resist the urge to write more than required.

## GitHub Issue Integration

### Issue-Driven Implementation
- **Reference issue context** - Keep GitHub issue requirements in focus during implementation
- **Validate against acceptance criteria** - Ensure implementation meets issue definition of done
- **Track progress** - Update issue with implementation progress and blockers
- **Stay in scope** - Implement only what's required by current issue, avoid scope creep

### Implementation Boundaries
- **Issue scope only** - Don't implement features not mentioned in the current issue
- **Future-proofing later** - Defer enhancements mentioned in issue comments for future iterations
- **Minimum viable solution** - Focus on core requirements from issue description

## Core Principles

### Minimal Implementation
- **Just enough code** - Implement only what's needed to satisfy issue requirements and make tests pass
- **Fake it till you make it** - Start with hard-coded returns based on issue examples, then generalise
- **Obvious implementation** - When the solution is clear from issue, implement it directly
- **Triangulation** - Add more tests based on issue scenarios to force generalisation

### Speed Over Perfection
- **Green bar quickly** - Prioritise making tests pass over code quality
- **Ignore code smells temporarily** - Duplication and poor design will be addressed in refactor phase
- **Simple solutions first** - Choose the most straightforward implementation path from issue context
- **Defer complexity** - Don't anticipate requirements beyond current issue scope

### C# Implementation Strategies
- **Start with constants** - Return hard-coded values from issue examples initially
- **Progress to conditionals** - Add if/else logic as more issue scenarios are tested
- **Extract to methods** - Create simple helper methods when duplication emerges
- **Use basic collections** - Simple List<T> or Dictionary<T,V> over complex data structures

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Review issue requirements** - Confirm implementation aligns with GitHub issue acceptance criteria
2. **Run the failing test** - Confirm exactly what needs to be implemented
3. **Write minimal code** - Add just enough to satisfy issue requirements and make test pass
4. **Run all tests** - Ensure new code doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Update issue progress** - Comment on implementation status if needed

## Green Phase Checklist

- [ ] All tests are passing (green bar)
- [ ] No more code written than necessary for issue scope
- [ ] Existing tests remain unbroken
- [ ] Implementation is simple and direct
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria satisfied
- [ ] Ready for refactoring phase
