You are a C# developer. Your goal is to implement and verify that an Aspire resource implements IResourceWithConnectionString.GetConnectionProperties and that it is documented, using specific rules.

## IResourceWithConnectionString.GetConnectionProperties rules

Common Connection properties are
- Host
- Port
- Password, when available
- UserName, when available
- Uri, representing a service resource url, like [protocol]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[subresource]?parameter=...
- Azure, ONLY when the resource may be hosted on Azure or not based on the context. With the value `"true"` if the resource is hosted on Azure, or `"false"` otherwise. This MUST NOT be defined when the resource doesn't have a `IsContainer`, `IsEmulator` or `InnerResource` property.
- DatabaseName
- JdbcConnectionString, a JDBC connection string format for the specific resource (search online Azure SDK documentation for reference formats).

If a `JdbcConnectionString` property doesn't exist and there is online documentation about connecting to this resource using JDBC, create it.

## Parent resources

When a resource class implement IResourceWithParent its connection properties should inherit its parent's ones. Then define it own to override the values, like Uri if applicable.

To inherit parent properties use the `ConnectionPropertiesExtensions.CombineProperties` method like this:

```c#
IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, ReferenceExpression>> IResourceWithConnectionString.GetConnectionProperties() =>
    Parent.CombineProperties([
        new("Database", ReferenceExpression.Create($"{DatabaseName}")),
        new("Uri", UriExpression),
        new("JdbcConnectionString", JdbcConnectionString),
    ]);
```

Where `Parent` comes from the `IResourceWithParent` interface.

## Documentation

Each Azure resource has an associated README.md file in the same folder. Update the README with the list of Connection Properties defined in `GetConnectionProperties`.

Here is a sample section for Sql Server:

```md
## Connection Properties

When you reference a SQL Server resource using `WithReference`, the following connection properties are made available to the consuming project:

### SQL Server server

The SQL Server server resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Host` | The hostname or IP address of the SQL Server |
| `Port` | The port number the SQL Server is listening on |
| `Username` | The username for authentication |
| `Password` | The password for authentication |
| `Uri` | The connection URI in mssql:// format, with the format `mssql://{Username}:{Password}@{Host}:{Port}` |
| `JdbcConnectionString` | JDBC-format connection string, with the format `jdbc:sqlserver://{Host}:{Port};user={Username};password={Password};trustServerCertificate=true` |

### SQL Server database

The SQL Server database resource inherits all properties from its parent `SqlServerServerResource` and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Uri` | The connection URI in mssql:// format, with the format `mssql://{Username}:{Password}@{Host}:{Port}/{DatabaseName}` |
| `JdbcConnectionString` | JDBC connection string with database name, with the format `jdbc:sqlserver://{Host}:{Port};user={Username};password={Password};trustServerCertificate=true;databaseName={DatabaseName}` |
| `Database` | The name of the database |

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `db1` becomes `DB1_URI`.
```

- The table should be formatted identically to this sample
- Each resource gets its own table
- Uri and JdbcConnectionString must have their format in the description
- The `Connection Properties` should be the last before external links like `Additional documentation`
