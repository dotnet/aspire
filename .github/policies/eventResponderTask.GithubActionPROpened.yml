# Github will not trigger github actions on PRs that were themselves created by a github action.
# We use github actions to run tests on PRs, and to backport PRs from one branch to another.
# A workaround for that behavior is to close & re-open such PRs, so that the last action is not by the Github-Action bot.
# This policy enacts that workaround.
