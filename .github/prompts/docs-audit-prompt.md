Analyze the following PR diff and generate detailed documentation requirements for a coding agent to implement.

Review the changes for:
- New public APIs, methods, classes, or interfaces
- New features or capabilities
- Breaking changes requiring migration guides
- New configuration options or settings
- Behavioral changes to existing features
- New command-line arguments or environment variables

Before making recommendations, check the Aspire documentation repository at https://github.com/microsoft/aspire.dev to:
- Identify existing documentation pages that should be updated
- Determine if a new documentation page should be created
- Find related documentation that needs cross-references
- Understand the current documentation structure and patterns

If documentation is needed, provide:
1. A clear title for the documentation task
2. Whether to UPDATE existing page(s) or CREATE new page(s)
   - For updates: List the specific file paths in the aspire.dev repo that need updating
   - For new pages: Suggest the file path and location where the new page should be added
3. Specific sections that need to be created or updated
4. Key points that must be covered in each section
5. Code examples that should be included (with placeholders for actual code)
6. Any warnings, notes, or best practices to document
7. Cross-references to related documentation pages

If no documentation is needed, respond with 'NO_DOCS_NEEDED'.

Format your response as a structured issue description that a coding agent can follow to implement the documentation.
