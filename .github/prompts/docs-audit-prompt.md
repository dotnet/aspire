Analyze the following PR diff and generate detailed documentation requirements for a coding agent to implement.

Review the changes for:
- New public APIs, methods, classes, or interfaces
- New features or capabilities
- Breaking changes requiring migration guides
- New configuration options or settings
- Behavioral changes to existing features
- New command-line arguments or environment variables

If documentation is needed, provide:
1. A clear title for the documentation task
2. Specific sections that need to be created or updated
3. Key points that must be covered in each section
4. Code examples that should be included (with placeholders for actual code)
5. Any warnings, notes, or best practices to document

If no documentation is needed, respond with 'NO_DOCS_NEEDED'.

Format your response as a structured issue description that a coding agent can follow to implement the documentation.
