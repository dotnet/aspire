The Aspire CLI is required to create and manage Aspire projects. Follow the instructions for your operating system:

## Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iex "& { $(irm https://aspire.dev/install.ps1) }"
```

## macOS/Linux (Bash)

```bash
curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash

After installation, the Aspire CLI will be available as the `aspire` command.
