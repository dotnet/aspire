# Restart VS Code

After installing the Aspire CLI, you need to fully restart VS Code for the environment PATH changes to take effect.

Click the button below to quit VS Code, then relaunch it:

[Quit VS Code](command:workbench.action.quit)

After relaunching VS Code, the `aspire` command will be available in the integrated terminal.
**Continue with the `Verify installation` step.**
