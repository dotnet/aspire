# Verify installation

Click the button below to verify that the Aspire CLI is properly installed and available on your system PATH:

[Verify Installation](command:aspire-vscode.verifyCliInstallation)

If the verification succeeds, you'll see a confirmation message. If it fails, you may need to:
1. Ensure the installation completed successfully
2. Fully restart VS Code (quit and relaunch)
3. Check that the CLI is in your system PATH

You can also manually verify by opening a new terminal and running:
```bash
aspire --version
```
