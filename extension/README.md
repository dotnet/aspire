# Aspire for Visual Studio Code

The official Aspire extension for VS Code. Run, debug, and deploy your Aspire apps without leaving the editor.

Aspire helps you build distributed apps — things like microservices, databases, containers, and frontends — and wire them together in code. This extension lets you do all of that from VS Code, with debugging support for **C#, Python, Node.js**, and more.

## Prerequisites

### Aspire CLI

The [Aspire CLI](https://aspire.dev/get-started/install-cli/) needs to be installed and on your PATH. You can install it directly from VS Code with the **Aspire: Install Aspire CLI (stable)** command, or follow the [installation guide](https://aspire.dev/get-started/install-cli/) for manual setup.

### .NET

[.NET 10 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) is required.

### VS Code

VS Code 1.98 or later is required.

---

## Getting Started

Open your Aspire project in VS Code, or create one with **Aspire: New Aspire project** from the Command Palette. Run **Aspire: Configure launch.json file** to set up the debug configuration, then press **F5**. The extension will build your apphost, start your services, attach debuggers, and open the dashboard.

There's also a built-in walkthrough at **Help → Get Started → Get started with Aspire** that covers the basics step by step.

---

## Running and Debugging

### Launch configuration

Add an entry to `.vscode/launch.json` pointing at your apphost project:

```json
{
    "type": "aspire",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Aspire: Launch MyAppHost",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj"
}
```

When you hit **F5**, the extension builds the apphost, starts all the resources (services, containers, databases) in the right order, hooks up debuggers based on each service's language, and opens the dashboard.

You can also right-click an `apphost.cs`, `apphost.ts`, or `apphost.js` file in the Explorer and pick **Run Aspire apphost** or **Debug Aspire apphost**.

### Deploy, publish, and pipeline steps

The `command` property in the launch config lets you do more than just run:

- **`deploy`** — push to your defined deployment targets.
- **`publish`** — generate deployment artifacts (manifests, Bicep files, etc.).
- **`do`** — run a specific pipeline step. Set `step` to the step name.

```json
{
    "type": "aspire",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Aspire: Deploy MyAppHost",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj",
    "command": "deploy"
}
```

### Customizing debugger settings per language

The `debuggers` property lets you pass debug config specific to a language. Use `project` for C#/.NET services, `python` for Python, and `apphost` for the apphost itself:

```json
{
    "type": "aspire",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Aspire: Launch MyAppHost",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj",
    "debuggers": {
        "project": {
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "logging": { "moduleLoad": false }
        },
        "apphost": {
            "stopAtEntry": true
        }
    }
}
```

---

## The Aspire Sidebar

The extension adds an **Aspire** panel to the Activity Bar. It shows a live tree of your resources. In **Workspace** mode you see resources from the apphost in your current workspace, updating in real time. Switch to **Global** mode with the toggle in the panel header to see every running apphost on your machine.

Right-click a resource to start, stop, or restart it, view its logs, run resource-specific commands, or open the dashboard.

---

## The Aspire Dashboard

The dashboard gives you a live view of your running app — all your resources and their health, endpoint URLs, console logs from every service, structured logs (via OpenTelemetry), distributed traces across services, and metrics.

It opens automatically when you start your app. You can pick which browser it uses with the `aspire.dashboardBrowser` setting — system default browser, or Chrome, Edge, or Firefox as a debug session. When using a debug browser, the `aspire.closeDashboardOnDebugEnd` setting controls whether it closes automatically when you stop debugging. Firefox also requires the [Firefox Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug) extension.

---

## Commands

All commands live in the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) under **Aspire**.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **New Aspire project** | Create a new apphost or starter app from a template |
| **Initialize Aspire in an existing codebase** | Add Aspire to an existing project |
| **Add an integration** | Add a hosting integration (`Aspire.Hosting.*`) |
| **Update integrations** | Update hosting integrations and the Aspire SDK |
| **Publish deployment artifacts** | Generate deployment manifests |
| **Deploy app** | Deploy to your defined targets |
| **Execute pipeline step** | Run a pipeline step and its dependencies (`aspire do`) |
| **Configure launch.json file** | Add the Aspire debug config to your workspace |
| **Extension settings** | Open Aspire settings |
| **Open local Aspire settings** | Open the local Aspire settings file for this workspace |
| **Open global Aspire settings** | Open the global Aspire settings file |
| **Open Aspire terminal** | Open a terminal with the Aspire CLI ready |
| **Install Aspire CLI (stable)** | Install the latest stable CLI |
| **Install Aspire CLI (daily)** | Install the daily preview build |
| **Update Aspire CLI** | Update the CLI |
| **Verify Aspire CLI installation** | Check that the CLI works |

## Language and Debugger Support

The extension figures out what language each resource uses and attaches the right debugger. Some languages need a companion extension:

| Language | Debugger | Extension needed |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| C# / .NET | coreclr | [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) or [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) |
| Python | debugpy | [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) |
| Node.js | js-debug (built-in) | None |
| Browser apps | js-debug (built-in) | None |
| Azure Functions | varies by language | [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) + language extension |

Node.js and browser debugging just work — VS Code has a built-in JavaScript debugger. C# Dev Kit gives you richer build integration than the standalone C# extension, but either one works for debugging. Azure Functions debugging supports C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python.

## Extension Settings

You can configure the extension under **Settings → Aspire**, or jump there with **Aspire: Extension settings**. The most commonly used:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `aspire.aspireCliExecutablePath` | `""` | Path to the Aspire CLI. Leave empty to use `aspire` from PATH. |
| `aspire.dashboardBrowser` | `openExternalBrowser` | Which browser to open the dashboard in — system default, or Chrome/Edge/Firefox as a debug session |
| `aspire.enableAspireDashboardAutoLaunch` | `launch` | Controls what happens with the dashboard when debugging starts: `launch` (auto-open), `notification` (show link), or `off` |
| `aspire.registerMcpServerInWorkspace` | `false` | Register the Aspire MCP server (see [below](#mcp-server-integration)) |

There are more settings for things like verbose logging, startup prompts, and polling intervals — run **Aspire: Extension settings** from the Command Palette to see them all.

The extension also gives you IntelliSense and validation when editing Aspire configuration files, including the new `aspire.config.json` format as well as the legacy `.aspire/settings.json` (workspace-level) and `~/.aspire/globalsettings.json` (user-level) files. Use the **Open local/global Aspire settings** commands to open them.

---

## MCP Server Integration

The extension can register an Aspire [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server with VS Code. This lets AI tools — GitHub Copilot included — see your running app's resources, endpoints, and configuration, so they have better context when helping you write code or answer questions.

Turn it on by setting `aspire.registerMcpServerInWorkspace` to `true`. When enabled, the extension registers the MCP server definition via the Aspire CLI whenever a workspace is open and the CLI is available.
