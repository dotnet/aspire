# AspireWithMaui Playground

This playground demonstrates .NET Aspire integration with .NET MAUI applications.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10 or later
- .NET MAUI workload

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

Before building or running the playground, you must restore dependencies and install the MAUI workload.

Run the following commands from the repository root:

**Windows:**
```cmd
.\restore.cmd -restore-maui
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./restore.sh --restore-maui
```

This will:
1. Restore all Aspire dependencies and set up the local .dotnet SDK
2. Install the MAUI workload into the repository's local `.dotnet` folder (does not affect your global installation)

> **Note:** The MAUI workload is installed only in the repository's local `.dotnet` folder and will not interfere with your system-wide .NET installation.
> This also means that you will still need to do this even if you have the MAUI workload already installed in your system-wide .NET installation.

### Running the Playground

After running the restore script with `-restore-maui`, you can build and run the playground:

**Using Visual Studio:**
1. Run `.\restore.cmd -restore-maui` from the repository root (Windows)
2. Open `AspireWithMaui.AppHost` project
3. Set it as the startup project
4. Press F5 to run

**Using VS Code:**
1. Run `.\restore.cmd -restore-maui` (Windows) or `./restore.sh --restore-maui` (Linux/macOS) from the repository root
2. From the repository root, run: `./start-code.sh` or `start-code.cmd`
3. Open the `AspireWithMaui` folder
4. Use the debugger to run the AppHost

**Using Command Line:**
1. Run `.\restore.cmd -restore-maui` (Windows) or `./restore.sh --restore-maui` (Linux/macOS) from the repository root
2. Navigate to `playground/AspireWithMaui/AspireWithMaui.AppHost` directory
3. Run: `dotnet run`

## What's Included

- **AspireWithMaui.AppHost** - The Aspire app host that orchestrates all services
- **AspireWithMaui.MauiClient** - A .NET MAUI application that connects to the backend (Windows and Mac Catalyst platforms)
- **AspireWithMaui.WeatherApi** - An ASP.NET Core Web API providing weather data
- **AspireWithMaui.ServiceDefaults** - Shared service defaults for non-MAUI projects
- **AspireWithMaui.MauiServiceDefaults** - Shared service defaults specific to MAUI projects

## Features Demonstrated

### MAUI Multi-Platform Support
The playground demonstrates Aspire's ability to manage MAUI apps on multiple platforms:
- **Windows**: Configures the MAUI app with `.AddWindowsDevice()`
- **Mac Catalyst**: Configures the MAUI app with `.AddMacCatalystDevice()`
- **Android Device**: Configures the MAUI app with `.AddAndroidDevice()` to run on physical Android devices
- **Android Emulator**: Configures the MAUI app with `.AddAndroidEmulator()` to run on Android emulators
  - Use `.AddAndroidEmulator()` to target the default/running emulator
  - Use `.AddAndroidEmulator(emulatorId: "Pixel_5_API_33")` to target a specific emulator
  - Get emulator names from `adb devices` command
- Automatically detects platform-specific target frameworks from the project file
- Shows "Unsupported" state in dashboard when running on incompatible host OS
- Sets up dev tunnels for MAUI app communication with backend services

### OpenTelemetry Integration
The MAUI client uses OpenTelemetry to send traces and metrics to the Aspire dashboard via dev tunnels.

### Service Discovery
The MAUI app discovers and connects to backend services (WeatherApi) using Aspire's service discovery.

### Environment Variables

All MAUI platform resources support environment variables using the standard `.WithEnvironment()` method:

```csharp
// For Windows and Mac Catalyst, environment variables are passed directly:
mauiapp.AddWindowsDevice()
    .WithEnvironment("DEBUG_MODE", "true")
    .WithEnvironment("API_TIMEOUT", "30");

// For Android, environment variables are passed via an intermediate MSBuild targets file, but the syntax to pass them is identical:
mauiapp.AddAndroidEmulator("debug-emulator")
    .WithEnvironment("DEBUG_MODE", "true")
    .WithEnvironment("API_TIMEOUT", "30")
    .WithEnvironment("LOG_LEVEL", "Debug");
```

#### Platform-Specific Implementation

- **Windows & Mac Catalyst**: Environment variables are passed directly through the process environment when launching via `dotnet run`.
- **Android**: Due to Android platform limitations, environment variables are written to a temporary MSBuild targets file that gets imported during the build. This happens automatically - no additional configuration required.
- **iOS**: (Coming soon) Will use a similar approach to Android with MSBuild targets file.

Environment variables are available in your MAUI app code regardless of platform through standard .NET environment APIs (`Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable()`).

### Future Platform Support
The architecture is designed to support additional platforms:
- Android support: `.AddAndroidDevice()` for physical devices, `.AddAndroidEmulator()` for emulators (implemented)
- iOS support: `.AddIosDevice()` extension method (coming in future updates)
- Parallel extension patterns for each platform

## Troubleshooting

### "MAUI workload not detected" Warning
If you see this warning in the Aspire dashboard:
1. Make sure you ran `.\restore.cmd -restore-maui` or `./restore.sh --restore-maui` from the repository root
2. The warning indicates the MAUI workload is not installed in the local `.dotnet` folder
3. Re-run the restore command with the `-restore-maui` or `--restore-maui` flag

### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors:
1. Ensure you ran the restore script with the MAUI flag first: `.\restore.cmd -restore-maui`
2. Make sure you're using .NET 10 RC or later
3. Try running `dotnet build` from the repository root first

### Platform-Specific Issues
- **Windows**: Requires Windows 10 build 19041 or higher for WinUI support. Mac Catalyst devices will show as "Unsupported" when running on Windows.
- **Mac Catalyst**: Requires macOS to run. Windows devices will show as "Unsupported" when running on macOS.
- **Android Device**: Requires a physical Android device connected via USB/WiFi debugging. Ensure the device is visible via `adb devices`. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Android Emulator**: Requires an Android emulator running and visible via `adb devices`. To target a specific emulator:
  1. List available emulators: `adb devices` (shows emulator IDs like "emulator-5554")
  2. Or list AVDs: `emulator -list-avds` (shows AVD names like "Pixel_5_API_33")
  3. Use either ID format in code: `.AddAndroidEmulator(emulatorId: "Pixel_5_API_33")` or `.AddAndroidEmulator(emulatorId: "emulator-5554")`
  4. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **iOS**: Not yet implemented in this playground (coming soon)

## Current Status

âœ… **Implemented:**
