/// <summary>
///   Demonstrates how to use the <see cref="EventProcessorClient"/> to process events from an Azure Event Hub.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   The EventProcessorClient in Azure Event Hubs is a powerful tool that allows for the processing of events from multiple partitions concurrently.
///   Itâ€™s crucial to spread the reading of partitions across multiple nodes for load balancing and to maximize throughput.
///   This is achieved by assigning each partition to a specific node, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed.
///   The EventProcessorClient is configured with a <see cref="BlobContainerClient"/> to store checkpoint and ownership data.
///   Use <see cref="EventProcessorClientOptions"/> to specify options such as the maximum wait time and prefetch count.
///   Proper configuration and usage of the EventProcessorClient can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of your Azure Event Hubs
///   applications. Remember to handle exceptions and monitor the health of your nodes to ensure smooth operation.
/// </remarks>
