## What is .NET Aspire?

.NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications. .NET Aspire is delivered through a collection of NuGet packages that handle specific cloud-native concerns. Cloud-native apps often consist of small, interconnected pieces or microservices rather than a single, monolithic code base. Cloud-native apps generally consume a large number of services, such as databases, messaging, and caching.

.NET Aspire helps with:

[Orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview?#orchestration): .NET Aspire provides features for running and connecting multi-project applications and their dependencies.

[Components](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview?#net-aspire-components): .NET Aspire components are NuGet packages for commonly used services, such as Redis or Postgres, with standardized interfaces ensuring they connect consistently and seamlessly with your app.

[Tooling](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview?#project-templates-and-tooling): .NET Aspire comes with project templates and tooling experiences for Visual Studio and the dotnet CLI which help you create and interact with .NET Aspire apps.

To learn more, read the full [.NET Aspire overview and documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/). Samples are available in the [.NET Aspire samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples).

You should evaluate whichever containers you chose to compose and automate with Aspire to ensure they meet your, your employers or your government’s requirements on security and safety as well as cryptographic regulations and any other regulatory or corporate standards that may apply to your use of the container.
