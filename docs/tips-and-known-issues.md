# Tips and known issues

## My containers aren't being created at all

We have seen Docker get into weird state on "DevBox" machines that get hibernated every evening. You can check if you got into this state by opening a command window and doing "docker ps". If it hangs forever without error, that is it.

The remedy is to do "Restart Docker" gesture from the Docker icon in system tray.

## If something goes wrong and you are left with a bunch of .NET Aspire eShopLite orphaned processes and containers

This will display process IDs of all the .NET Aspire shopping running processes

```ps1
ps | where ProcessName -cmatch '(Api)|(Catalog)|(Basket)|(AppHost)|(MyFrontend)|(OrderProcessor)' | % {Write-Output $_.Id }
```

â€¦ and this will kill them

```ps1
ps | where ProcessName -cmatch '(Api)|(Catalog)|(Basket)|(AppHost)|(MyFrontend)|(OrderProcessor)' | % {Write-Output $_.Id; kill $_.Id }
```

## Why does it seem to take a long time for my services to reach a ready state when running in Visual Studio?

There is a known performance issue in Visual Studio 2022 17.9 Preview 1 related to a debugger setting which can cause delays during service startup for a .NET Aspire AppHost project with multiple service projects. To work around this issue, go to `Tools > Options > Debugging > General` and uncheck `Enable the External Sources node in Solution Explorer`.
