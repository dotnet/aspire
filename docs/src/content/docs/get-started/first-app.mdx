Aspire includes tooling to help you create and configure cloud-native apps. The tooling includes useful starter project templates and other features to streamline getting started with Aspire for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and CLI workflows. Assuming you have the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) installed, you can install the Aspire CLI and create a new project.

<Steps>

1. Create a new Aspire solution:

    ```console title="Create a new aspire solution"
    aspire new aspire-starter -n AspireApp -o AspireApp
    ```

    <Aside type='tip' title='Addition CLI option details'>
      The `aspire-starter` template provides several projects, including an API service, web frontend, and app host.
      
      - `-n`: specifies the name of the solution.
      - `-o`: specifies the output directory.
    </Aside>

    When prompted to choose a template version, use the <Kbd windows="↑" mac="↑" /> and <Kbd windows="↓" mac="↓" /> keys to navigate the options. 
    Press <Kbd windows="Enter" mac="Return" /> to confirm your selection.

1. Verify the solution was created successfully. The Aspire CLI creates a new folder named _AspireApp_ in the current directory. This folder contains the solution file and several projects, including:

    <FileTree>

    - AspireApp.sln
    - AspireApp.ApiService
        - Properties/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.ApiService.csproj
        - Program.cs
    - **AspireApp.AppHost** this is your local **dev-time** orchestrator
        - Properties/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.AppHost.csproj
        - Program.cs
    - AspireApp.ServiceDefaults
        - Extensions.cs
        - AspireApp.ServiceDefaults.csproj
    - AspireApp.Web
        - Properties/
        - wwwroot/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.Web.csproj
        - Program.cs
        - WeatherApiClient.cs
    </FileTree>

    This relies on the Aspire templates. If they're not installed already, the CLI will install them for you.

1. Change to the _output_ directory:

    ```console title="Change directories—stepping into the output directory"
    cd ./AspireApp
    ```

1. Run the Aspire app host project:

    ```console title="Run dev-time orchestration"
    aspire run
    ```

    The Aspire CLI locates the app host project, builds the solution, runs dev-time orchestration, and when the dashboard is ready—it's URL with login token are output to the console, finally  he resources are represented with live states as well:

    ```console frame="none"
    aspire run

    Dashboard:
    📈  https://localhost:17076/login?t=<Your session's access token>

    ╭─────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬────────────────────────╮
    │ Resource    │ Type    │ State   │ Endpoint(s)            │
    ├─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼────────────────────────┤
    │ apiservice  │ Project │ Running │ https://localhost:7393 │
    │             │         │         │ http://localhost:5555  │
    │ webfrontend │ Project │ Running │ https://localhost:7214 │
    │             │         │         │ http://localhost:5124  │
    ╰─────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴────────────────────────╯
    Press Ctrl+C to stop the app host and exit.
    ```

1. Explore the running distributed application. From the dashboard, open the `HTTPS` endpoint from each resource.

1. Stop the app host and close the dashboard by pressing <Kbd windows="Ctrl+C" mac="⌘+C" />.

    **Congratulations! You've created your first Aspire app.**
