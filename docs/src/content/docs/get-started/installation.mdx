Aspire includes tooling to help you create and configure cloud-native apps. The tooling includes useful starter project templates and other features to streamline getting started with Aspire for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and CLI workflows. Assuming you have the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) installed, you can install the Aspire CLI and create a new project.

<Steps>

1. Install the Aspire CLI:

    ```console title="Install the Aspire CLI globally"
    dotnet tool install --global aspire.cli --prerelease
    ```

    <Aside type='note'>
      The Aspire CLI is currently in preview, hence the `--prerelease` flag is used.
    </Aside>

1. Verify the installation by calling the CLI help command:

    ```console title="Aspire CLI help command"
    aspire --help
    ```

    You should see an example usage format, with a list of available options and commands, similar to the following:
