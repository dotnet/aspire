## Why developers love Aspire

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Code-centric Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in code—no YAML. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev and deploy, fully wired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your existing stack—frontends, APIs, containers, databases, and more — without rewriting or replatforming. Extend Aspire for anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Logs, traces, health checks—all local, all wired up automatically. OpenTelemetry included with zero setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Ship it how you **want** — to Kubernetes, your own infra, or managed services. Aspire adapts to your environment, not the other way around.

## Local-first, Production-ready

Aspire is designed to be local-first, meaning you can develop and test your applications in a local environment that closely mirrors production. This approach reduces the "works on my machine" problem and ensures a smoother transition to production.

## OpenTelemetry developer dashboard

Monitor logs, metrics, and traces in real time with the built-in OpenTelemetry dashboard—insightful, visual, and ready out of the box.
