## Why developers love Aspire

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Code-First Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in code—no YAML. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev and deploy, fully wired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your existing stack—frontends, APIs, containers, databases, and more — without rewriting or replatforming. Extend Aspire for anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Logs, traces, health checks—all local, all wired up automatically. OpenTelemetry included with zero setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Ship it how you **want** — to Kubernetes, your own infra, or managed services. Aspire adapts to your environment, not the other way around.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Code-Centric Control

Describe your stack in code. Easily add services, connect them to each other, and get everything running locally with a single command.

import ThreeTierAspire from '../../components/ThreeTierAspire.astro';

## Same model, different environments.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">

  <Code code={'aspire run'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Runs with your local container runtime
  - Dashboard available on `localhost`
  - Uses dev secrets, volumes, dev-time config

  </Card>

  <Card title="Production Deployment" icon="rocket">

  <Code code={'aspire publish'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Same app structure, deployed where you want
  - Use managed cloud services or your own infra
  - Works with your pipeline, no code changes required
