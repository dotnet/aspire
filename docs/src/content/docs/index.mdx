## Why developers love Aspire

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Code-First Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in code—no YAML. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev and deploy, fully wired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your existing stack—frontends, APIs, containers, databases, and more — without rewriting or replatforming. Extend Aspire for anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Logs, traces, health checks—all local, all wired up automatically. OpenTelemetry included with zero setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Ship it how you **want** — to Kubernetes, your own infra, or managed services. Aspire adapts to your environment, not the other way around.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Production Deployment" icon="rocket">

  <Code code={'aspire publish'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Same app structure, deployed where you want
  - Use managed cloud services or your own infra
