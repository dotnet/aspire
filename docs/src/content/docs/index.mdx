## Why developers love Aspire

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Code-centric Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in code—no YAML. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev and deploy, fully wired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your existing stack—frontends, APIs, containers, databases, and more — without rewriting or replatforming. Extend Aspire for anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Logs, traces, health checks—all local, all wired up automatically. OpenTelemetry included with zero setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Ship it how you **want** — to Kubernetes, your own infra, or managed services. Aspire adapts to your environment, not the other way around.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Powerful CLI

**Aspire's interactive CLI puts the power of orchestration at your fingertips**—run your entire stack locally with a single command, the dashboard launches on `run` and view resource health in real time, and publish to any environment with ease.

import AsciinemaPlayer from '../../components/AsciinemaPlayer.astro'

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/aspire/casts/demo.cast" />

## Code-centric control

Slide to reveal how defining your stack in C# with Aspire compares to traditional Docker Compose.

import ThreeTierAspire from '../../components/ThreeTierAspire.astro';

## Same model—different environments

**Model your stack in C#—not YAML**, fully type-safe—for seamless development, staging, and production deployments.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">

  <Code code={'aspire run'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Runs with your local container runtime
  - Dashboard available on `localhost`
  - Uses dev secrets, volumes, dev-time config
  
  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI — run'
            description='Run your entire stack locally—instantly orchestrated for development.' />

  </Card>

  <Card title="Production Deployment" icon="rocket">

  <Code code={'aspire publish'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Same app structure, deployed where you want
  - Use managed cloud services or your own infra
  - Works with your pipeline, no code changes required

  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI — deploy'
            description='Model your app once—deploy anywhere, from cloud to on-prem.' />

## Local-first, Production-ready

**Aspire is designed to be local-first**, meaning you develop and test your applications on your local machine and Aspire strives to closely mirror production. This approach reduces the "works on my machine" problem and ensures a smoother transition to production.

## Works with your existing CI/CD

**Aspire enhances your pipeline** — it doesn't replace your security scans, linting, or testing. Integrate Aspire deployment into GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, or any CI/CD system.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="What Aspire Adds" icon="approve-check">
    - **Orchestration**: Manages service connections and configuration
    - **Local Development**: Consistent dev environment for your team
    - **Deployment**: Publishes to your target infrastructure
  </Card>
  <Card title="What You Keep" icon="seti:lock">
    - **Security Scanning**: SAST, dependency checks, vulnerability scans
    - **Quality Gates**: Unit tests, integration tests, code coverage
    - **Approval Processes**: Manual approvals, staging validations
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## OpenTelemetry developer dashboard

**Monitor logs, metrics, and traces in real time with the built-in OpenTelemetry dashboard**—insightful, visual, and ready out of the box.
