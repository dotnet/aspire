# CI trigger patterns
#
# This file lists glob patterns for files whose changes do NOT require the full CI
# to run (e.g. documentation, non-build pipeline scripts, or specific workflow files
# that are unrelated to the build and test process).
#
# When all files changed in a pull request match at least one pattern here, the CI
# workflow is skipped.
#
# Pattern syntax:
#   **   matches any path including directory separators (recursive)
#   *    matches any characters except a directory separator
#   .    is treated as a literal dot (no escaping needed)
#   All other characters are treated as literals.
#
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored.

# This file itself - changing CI-skip patterns doesn't require a CI run.
# Note: this also means a syntax error introduced here won't be caught by CI,
# so take care when editing. Pattern conversion is validated by the
# check-changed-files action at runtime.
