# Aspire.Hosting library

Core abstractions for the .NET Aspire application model. It provides the building blocks for the distributed application
hosting model. This package should not be referenced by AppHost projects directly. Instead use the `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost`
package to add a transitive referencing including custom build targets to support code generation of metadata
types for referenced .NET projects.
