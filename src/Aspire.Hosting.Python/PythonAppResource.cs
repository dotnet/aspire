/// Represents a Python application resource in the distributed application model.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This resource allows Python applications (scripts, web servers, APIs, background services) to run as part
/// of a distributed application. The resource manages the Python executable, working directory,
/// and lifecycle of the Python application.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Python applications can expose HTTP endpoints, communicate with other services, and participate
/// in service discovery like other Aspire resources. They support automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation
/// for observability when configured with the appropriate Python packages.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This resource supports various Python execution environments including:
/// - System Python installations
/// - Virtual environments (venv)
/// - Conda environments  
/// - UV-based Python environments
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// Add a Python web application using Flask or FastAPI:
/// <code lang="csharp">
/// var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
/// 
/// var python = builder.AddPythonApp("api", "../python-api", "app.py")
///     .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 5000)
///     .WithArgs("--host", "0.0.0.0");
/// 
/// builder.AddProject&lt;Projects.Frontend&gt;("frontend")
///     .WithReference(python);
/// 
/// builder.Build().Run();
/// </code>

/// - An absolute path: "/usr/bin/python3"

/// - A command on the PATH: "python" or "python3"
/// The executable is typically located in a virtual environment's bin (Linux/macOS) or Scripts (Windows) directory.
/// </param>
/// <param name="appDirectory">
/// The working directory for the Python application. Python scripts and modules
