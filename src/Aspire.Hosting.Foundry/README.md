# Aspire.Hosting.Foundry library

Provides extension methods and resource definitions for an Aspire AppHost to configure Microsoft Foundry.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

### Install the package

In your AppHost project, install the Aspire Microsoft Foundry Hosting library with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Foundry
```

## Configure Azure Provisioning for local development

Adding Azure resources to the Aspire application model will automatically enable development-time provisioning
for Azure resources so that you don't need to configure them manually. Provisioning requires a number of settings
to be available via .NET configuration. Set these values in user secrets in order to allow resources to be configured
automatically.

```json
{
    "Azure": {
      "SubscriptionId": "<your subscription id>",
      "ResourceGroupPrefix": "<prefix for the resource group>",
      "Location": "<azure location>"
    }
}
```

## Usage example

Then, in the _AppHost.cs_ file of `AppHost`, add a Microsoft Foundry deployment and consume the connection using the following methods:

```csharp
var chat = builder.AddFoundry("foundry")
                  .AddDeployment("chat", "Phi-4", "1", "Microsoft");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyService>()
                       .WithReference(chat);
```

The `WithReference` method passes that connection information into a connection string named `chat` in the `MyService` project.

### Configuring deployment rate limits

The `SkuCapacity` property controls the rate limit in thousands of tokens per minute (TPM). For example, a value of `10` means 10,000 TPM. The default is `1` (1,000 TPM). Use `WithProperties` to configure it:

```csharp
var chat = builder.AddFoundry("foundry")
                  .AddDeployment("chat", "gpt-4", "1", "OpenAI")
                  .WithProperties(d => d.SkuCapacity = 10);
```

See the [Azure AI quota management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/quota) documentation for available quota limits per model and region.

In the _Program.cs_ file of `MyService`, the connection can be consumed using a client library like [Aspire.Azure.AI.Inference](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.AI.Inference) or [Aspire.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.OpenAI) if the model is compatible with the OpenAI API:

Note: The `format` parameter of the `AddDeployment()` method can be found in the Microsoft Foundry portal in the details
page of the model, right after the `Quick facts` text.

#### Inference client usage
```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat")
       .AddChatClient();
```

#### OpenAI client usage
```csharp
builder.AddOpenAIClient("chat")
       .AddChatClient();
```

### Emulator usage

Aspire supports the usage of Foundry Local. Add the following to your AppHost project:

```csharp
// AppHost
var chat = builder.AddFoundry("foundry")
                  .RunAsFoundryLocal()
                  .AddDeployment("chat", "phi-3.5-mini", "1", "Microsoft");
```

When the AppHost starts up, the local Foundry service will also be started.

This requires the local machine to have [Foundry Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/get-started) installed and running.

## Connection Properties

When you reference Microsoft Foundry resources using `WithReference`, the following connection properties are made available to the consuming project:

### Microsoft Foundry resource

The Microsoft Foundry resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Uri` | The endpoint URI for the Microsoft Foundry resource, with the format `https://<resource_name>.services.ai.azure.com/` or the emulator service URI when running Foundry Local (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:61799/v1`) |
| `Key` | The API key when using Foundry Local |

### Microsoft Foundry deployment

The Microsoft Foundry deployment resource inherits all properties from its parent Microsoft Foundry resource and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `ModelName` | The deployment name when targeting Azure or model identifier when running Foundry Local, e.g., `Phi-4`, `my-chat` |
| `Format` | The deployment format, e.g., `OpenAI`, `Microsoft`, `xAi`, `Deepseek` |
| `Version` | The deployment version, e.g., `1`, `2025-08-07` |

### Microsoft Foundry project

The Microsoft Foundry project resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Uri` | The project endpoint URI, with the format `https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>` |
| `ConnectionString` | The connection string, with the format `Endpoint=<uri>` |
| `ApplicationInsightsConnectionString` | The Application Insights connection string for telemetry |

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `chat` becomes `CHAT_URI`.

## Microsoft Foundry project usage

You can create a Microsoft Foundry project resource to organize agents and model deployments:

```csharp
var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project");

var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", "gpt-4", "1.0", "OpenAI");

var myService = builder.AddPythonApp("agent", "./app", "main:app")
                       .WithReference(project);
```

The project can also be configured with additional Azure resources:

```csharp
var appInsights = builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights("ai");
var keyVault = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("kv");

var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project")
                     .WithAppInsights(appInsights)
                     .WithKeyVault(keyVault);
```

## Hosted agent usage

To deploy a containerized application as a hosted agent in Microsoft Foundry:

```csharp
var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project");

builder.AddPythonApp("agent", "./app", "main:app")
       .PublishAsHostedAgent(project);
```

In run mode, the agent runs locally with health check endpoints and OpenTelemetry instrumentation. In publish mode, the agent is deployed as a hosted agent in Microsoft Foundry.
