# Aspire AI Foundry Hosted Agent Template

This is a starting point for building an AI chat application using Azure AI Foundry. It has a local Python agent that can be run
with `aspire run`, and it will provision and connect to resources in Azure. When `aspire deploy` is run, this will deploy to an
Azure subscription and provision resources as needed.
