# Overview

Aspire components are classic .NET NuGet packages which are designed as highly usable libraries. Aspire components feature rich production-ready telemetry, health checks, configurability, testability, and documentation. For the current state of the components included in this repo and tracked for Aspire's first preview, please check out the [Aspire Components Progress](./Aspire_Components_Progress.md) page.

# Best practices for development

## Naming

- Each component's name should contain just an `Aspire.` prefix.
- When component is built around `ABC` client library, it should contain the client library name in its name. Example: `Aspire.ABC`.
- When given client library is just one of many libraries that allows to consume given service, the names that refer to component need to be specific, not generic. Example: Npgsql is not the only db driver for PostgreSQL database, so the extension method should be called `AddNpgsql` rather than `AddPostgreSQL`.

## Configuration

- Each component should provide it's own public and `sealed` `Settings` type.
  > [!NOTE]
  > This type does not use the name `Options` because it is not an `IOptions`. `IOptions` objects can be configured through dependency injection. These settings needs to be read before the DI container is built, so they can't be `IOptions`.
- The settings type name should be unique (no generic names like `ConfigurationOptions`), don't contain an `Aspire` prefix and follow the client-lib name. Example: when a component wraps an `ABC` client library, the component is called `Aspire.ABC` and the settings type is called `ABCSettings`.
- When a new instance of the settings type is created, its properties should return the recommended/default values (so when they are bound to an empty config they still return the right values).
- Settings should be bound to a section of `IConfiguration` exposed by `IHostApplicationBuilder.Configuration`.
- Each component should determine a constant configuration section name for its settings under the `Aspire` config section.
- All configuration knobs exposed by the settings type should be public and mutable, so they can be changed in the config and applied without a need for re-compiling the application.
- Each component should expose an optional lambda that accepts an instance of given settings type. By doing that, we provide the users with a possibility to override the bound config values (make final changes).
- When a mandatory config property is missing, an exception should be thrown, and it should contain information about the config path that was used to read it.

```csharp
public static void AddAbc(this IHostApplicationBuilder builder, Action<AbcSettings>? configureSettings = null)
{
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(builder);

    var settings = new AbcSettings();
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("Aspire:Abc").Bind(settings);

    configureSettings?.Invoke(settings);

    if (settings.MandatoryPropertyIsMissing)
        throw new MeaningfulException($"MandatoryPropertyName was not found at configuration path 'Aspire:Abc:{nameof(AbcSettings.MandatoryPropertyName)}'");
}
```

### Named Configuration

- Components should allow for multiple (named) instances to be registered in the application.
- The configuration for each named instance will come from a section under the component's section with the name corresponding to the name provided when the component was registered.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Abc": {
      "named_one": {

      },
      "named_two": {

      }
    }
  }
}
```

- These settings can be configured hierarchically, so common settings can be set at `Aspire:Abc` and each named section can provide settings specific to it. The named settings override the common settings.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Abc": {
      "MySetting": true,

      "named_one": {
        // inherits MySetting=true
      },
      "named_two": {
        "MySetting": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Health Checks

Aspire components expose health checks enabling applications to track and respond to the remote service’s health.

- Health checks should be enabled by default, but the users should be able to disable them via configuration.
- [AddHealthChecks(this IServiceCollection)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.healthcheckservicecollectionextensions) should be used to register health checks.
- If the client library provides an integration with `HealthCheckService` (example: [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks#entity-framework-core-dbcontext-probe)) it should be used.
- If there is an established open-source health check (example: [AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Redis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Redis)) it should be used. If the existing health check library doesn't meet our requirements, efforts should be made to add the necessary functionality to the existing library.
- Otherwise we need to implement [IHealthCheck](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.diagnostics.healthchecks.ihealthcheck) and register it via [HealthCheckRegistration](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.diagnostics.healthchecks.healthcheckregistration).
- Consider whether the Health Check should reuse the same client object registered in DI by the component or not. Reusing the same client object has the advantages of getting the same configuration, logging, etc during the health check.
- Calling [MapHealthChecks](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.healthcheckendpointroutebuilderextensions.maphealthchecks) is outside of the scope of a Component.

## Resilience

Aspire components leverage configurable resilience patterns such as retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers to maximize availability. This functionality is configurable and seamlessly integrates with higher level resilience strategies implemented at the application level.

- Each component must ensure that by default reasonable timeouts are enabled. It should be possible to configure the timeouts.
- If the client library provides connection pooling, it should be enabled by default (to scale proportionally). It should be possible to disable it via configuration.
- If given client library provides built in mechanism for retries, it should be enabled by default and configurable.
- It's not always possible to implement retries. Example: raw db driver does not know, whether currently executed command is part of a transaction or not. If it is, re-trying a failed command won't help as the whole transaction has already failed.

## Telemetry

Aspire components offer integrated logging, metrics, and tracing using modern .NET abstractions (ILogger, Meter, Activity). Telemetry is schematized and part of a component’s contract, ensuring backward compatibility across versions of the component.

- The Component's telemetry names should conform to [OpenTelemetry's Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions) when available.
- Components are allowed to use OpenTelemetry [Instrumentation Libraries](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/glossary/#instrumentation-library), if available. (example: [OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.StackExchangeRedis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.StackExchangeRedis)).
- The Component should use `ILoggerFactory`/`ILogger` objects that come from DI.
- If possible, no information should be logged twice (example: raw db driver and Entity Framework can both log SQL queries, when they are used together only one should be logging).
- Defining [telemetry exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/net/exporters/) is outside of the scope of a Component.

## Performance

- Entity Framework DbContext pooling should be enabled by default, but it should be possible to disable it (example: multi-tenant application where `DbContext` may contain data specific to customer and should not be reused for other customers).
- Registering a `DbDataSource` and obtaining a `DbConnection` from it should be preferred over instantiating `DbConnection` directly with a connection string.
- Before every component is shipped, we should measure how applying the recommended settings affect performance.

## Azure Components

### Configuration

- Azure SDK libraries already have a `ClientOptions` type that is an `IOptions`. These options provide general HTTP options like `RetryOptions` and `DiagnosticsOptions`, but also service-specific options, like `ServiceBusClientOptions.ConnectionIdleTimeout`.
- Since users will need to be able to configure both `Aspire` settings and these `ClientOptions` options, we will nest the `ClientOptions` configuration under the components configuration section.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging:ServiceBus": {
        // Aspire settings
        "HealthChecks": false,
        "Namespace": "aspire-servicebus.servicebus.windows.net",

        // Azure SDK's ServiceBusClientOptions
        "ClientOptions": {
          "RetryOptions": {
            "MaxRetries": 2,
            "Delay": "00:00:01"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- These `ClientOptions` can be configured hierarchically as well, so common Azure options can be configured for all Azure components. And each component can override the shared settings.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      // These ClientOptions apply to all Azure components
      "ClientOptions": {
        "RetryOptions": {
          "MaxRetries": 2,
          "Delay": "00:00:01"
        }
      },

      "Messaging:ServiceBus": {
        "Namespace": "aspire-servicebus.servicebus.windows.net",

        // These ClientOptions apply to the ServiceBus component and override the above options
        "ClientOptions": {
          "RetryOptions": {
            "MaxRetries": 3
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Security

- If the underlying client library supports passwordless/[RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) authentication, which Credential to use should be configurable through the Aspire Settings object. For example:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBus(settings =>
{
    settings.Credential = 
        new ChainedTokenCredential(
            new VisualStudioCredential(),
            new VisualStudioCodeCredential());
});
```

- If the underlying client library supports secret credentials (like a connection string), this should be read from `IConfiguration`. This can be placed either in the component-specific section, or under the global `ConnectionStrings` section. If both are specified, the component-specific section is used. For example:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus": "Endpoint=sb://foo;..."
  },
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging:ServiceBus": {
        "ConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://foo;..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Alternatively, the ConnectionString should be able to be configured through the Aspire Settings object. For example:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBus(settings =>
{
    settings.ConnectionString = "xyz";
});
```

- If both secret and passwordless mechanisms are configured, the secret credential overrides the passwordless identity setting.
