# JavaScript Libraries

The .NET Aspire Dashboard bundles a few JavaScript libraries.

## Plotly

The default Plotly JS library is around 4MB in size (minified), as it supports many different chart types. Currently, we only use simple chart types, so can use the `basic` distribution which is around 1MB instead.

From [Plotly JS's docs](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/22efc2fb76f4c890a2c33448e6f1485ecab77f26/dist/README.md#plotlyjs-basic):

> The `basic` partial bundle contains trace modules `bar`, `pie` and `scatter`.

If we ever want to show more chart types than those, we'll need to change the bundle we use.
