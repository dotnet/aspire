For their unique forms, customers can build their own model that extracts key values by using custom forms. These extracted values then become actionable data for various workflows within their business. - **Bank form processing**: A bank can use the prebuilt ID model and custom forms to speed up the data entry for &quot;know your customer&quot; documentation, or to speed up data entry for a mortgage packet. If a bank requires their customers to submit personal identification as part of a process, the prebuilt ID model can extract key values, such as Name and Document Number, speeding up the overall time for data entry. - **Robotic process automation (RPA)**: Using the custom extraction model, customers can extract specific data needed from distinct types of documents. The key-value pair extracted can then be entered into various systems such as databases, or CRM systems, through RPA, replacing manual data entry. Customers can also use custom classification model to categorize documents based on their content and file them in proper location. As such, an organized set of data extracted from the custom model can be an essential first step to document RPA scenarios for businesses that manage large volumes of documents regularly. ## Benefits - **No experience required**: Incorporate Document Intelligence features into your projects with no machine learning experience required. - **Effortlessly customize your models**: Training your own custom extraction and classification model can be done with as little as one document labeled, making it easy to train your own models. - **State of the art models**: ready for use APIs, constantly enhanced models, and flexible deployment options reduce the need for ongoing manual training or extensive customization. ## Technical Details: - **Deployment**: Deployment options may vary by service, reference the following docs for more information: [Use Document Intelligence models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/use-sdk-rest-api?view=doc-intel-3.1.0&amp;tabs=linux&amp;pivots=programming-language-rest-api) and [Install and run containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/containers/install-run?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&amp;tabs=read). - **Requirements**: Requirements may vary slightly depending on the model you are using to analyze the documents.
